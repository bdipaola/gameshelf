Quarriors!,Dice,2,4,"Players take on the roles of Quarriors - mighty mystical warriors who have the power to capture dangerous quarry from the untamed Wilds! They must conjure the mysterious powers of Quiddity, cast powerful spells, and summon their creatures to battle if they hope to overcome rivals and earn their rightful place as the Champion!&#10;&#10;Quarriors has the frenetic excitement of a dice battle game, with an added &lsquo;deckbuilding&rsquo; twist: players customize their dice pools during the game using resources generated by their rolls.&#10;&#10;Quarriors takes the best of deckbuilding games without the tedium of shuffling.  Take a typical deckbuilding game, add the speed and fun of dice and in 60 minutes you&rsquo;re on your second or third game trying unique strategies against your opponents.&#10;&#10;Alternate Description of Quarriors&#10;&#10;In Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form &quot;the Wilds&quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.&#10;&#10;Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!&#10;&#10;"

Haste Worte?,Party Game,3,8,"Haste Worte is a party/word game from Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling.  Each turn  players have 30 seconds to write as many answers for the category or question that round.  After 30 seconds expire, players must bid on how many unique answers they have on their list.  Bids are revealed simultaneously with players having the lowest bids reading their answers first.  Any answer already named gets crossed of a players list before they get a chance to take their turn.  Players score points equal to their bids if they make it and the first one around the board wins.&#10;&#10;In 2003 Spielzeit published a version of the game without a board.  The board is built using the backs of some of the cards.&#10;&#10;"

Give Me the Brain!,Card Game,3,8,"Working in fast-food is hell.  All the employees are zombies, and you can't find a single brain amongst them.  Except for the brain part - there is, in fact, one brain - that's the premise of Give Me the Brain!, a card game in which players take on the roles of zombies in a fast-food restaurant in hell.  They all have to complete a number of tasks before leaving work, and the work keeps piling on.  Even worse, some of the tasks require basic intelligence and there's only one brain to go around.&#10;&#10;"
Frank's Zoo,Animals,3,7,"This game is played in several hands. In each hand the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards. Their scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards. There are two ways to play: you can play where all hands are played the same, or you can play the game with changing partners.&#10;&#10;This is a climbing game, similar to The Great Dalmuti, Tichu, and others.  The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals. Each is scared away only by certain other animals.  Players set out one to whatever cards of a particular variety, and someone can play onto that pile only if they have more of that animal or an equal number of some animal that can scare it away.  Players get points by playing all their cards, collecting lions, and collecting a hedgehog.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://doris-frank.de/Games4.html&#10;&#10;"
King's Breakfast,Card Game,3,5,"The king has invited you to his castle for breakfast.  During the feast the players will take portions of various dishes from the table to eat.  As a good host, the king will serve all his guests before taking any portion from each course.  From time to time, his pet dragon Emerald will steal some food from his master.  Of course, it is rude for a player to have more of a dish than the king, so players must be careful not to be too greedy.  In the end, the winner is the player who gets the most to eat of the things the king likes best without eating more than the king eats of any dish.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     BrettspielWelt (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Balanx,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"Balanx is a 2 player balancing game by Kris Burm. The game has a low plastic see-saw grid with spaced grooves. Players have 10 heavy glass marbles in black and white, the same as found in Abalone, and 2 small steel ball bearings.&#10;Players start with their marbles on the opposite side and corner of the grid and move them towards themselves forwards and sideways, but not diagonally. The trick is that before a player moves, they hold the balancing board down on their side, making the marbles roll along the grooves and changing the set up entirely. In addition, the steel balls run in side grooves, affecting the balance of the board and making the game very challenging.&#10;The winner is the first to get their balls across to their corner, but if any balls are left in the opponents corner to block a finish, you lose. &#10;Rules in English, French, Dutch and Swedish.&#10;&#10;Was awarded the title &quot;Best Abstract Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1997.&#10;&#10;"
Time's Up!,Humor,4,18,"Time's Up! is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two). Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck of famous names is used for each of the game's three rounds.&#10;&#10;In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!&#10;&#10;Time's Up! is based on the public domain game known as Celebrities.&#10;&#10;"

Relic Runners,Exploration,2,5,"In Relic Runners, each player takes on the role of a character keen to exploit and acquire relics that have been unearthed in a long lost part of the jungle. Each would-be archaeologist has a colorful past &mdash; retired university professor, former army captain, etc. &mdash; and wants to be the first to get their hands on the precious loot to earn the most victory points.&#10;&#10;Players must navigate a series of paths in order to visit temples. The archaeologists are restricted in their movement by their access to rations, but thankfully they can place markers on paths to allow them to travel for free in future turns. The players also have a toolkit that can be upgraded in three particular ways to break the rules in some way or offer them an advantage as they move around.&#10;&#10;Each time a player visits a temple, he takes a token. Initially the temples offer up victory points or some form of in-game bonus. When the final token is taken, a relic is placed there to be collected. The players earn large victory points for collecting relics of different types (set collection) and players can also earn bonus points for creating long routes and traveling along these to collect relics.&#10;&#10;"
Medina,Abstract Strategy,3,4,"The year is 1822.  After years of decay, it is time to rebuild the medina, located at the foot of the Atlas mountains. The architects and engineers of the city work to erect large and beautiful palaces and to renovate the damaged city wall. As the reconstruction of the old city progresses, the city's inhabitants flock through the alleys, and the contours of the new city gradually reappear!&#10;&#10;Each turn, players must place two pieces on the board, either augmenting an existing building or starting a new building if the current building of that color is finished. Each player will claim one building of each of the four colors by the end of the game, giving one point per wooden piece attached to the building.&#10;&#10;Also, if you own the largest building of a particular color you get a bonus for that color. Finally, there are bonuses for the player who most recently connected one of their buildings to the walls, which grow from the four corners of the city.&#10;&#10;Medina is a tense game by the great designer Stefan Dorra.&#10;&#10;In 2014, Medina was re-released with new components, as well as changed and 2-player rules.

Acquire,Economic,3,6,"This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher.  Each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.&#10;&#10;Some versions of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant.&#10;&#10;The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.&#10;&#10;"
Blink,Action / Dexterity,2,3,"The two-minute-long, two-player card game Blink bills itself as the fastest game in the world. Without taking turns, players race to empty their hands by matching the color, shape, or number of symbols on their cards in hand to the top card of the two discard piles in the center of the table. As soon as a player lays down one card, they can draw another, up to the hand size of three cards. If a player can't play, they can discard one card, then draw another. The first player to empty their hand and draw pile wins.&#10;&#10;The rulebook includes variants for three- and four-player games.&#10;&#10;Blink: Bible Edition is the same game with Christian faith icons.&#10;&#10;"
The Bottle Imp,Card Game,3,4,"In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).&#10;&#10;Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.&#10;&#10;In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L. Stevenson http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/bottlimp.htm is included (in both English &amp; German) and the bottle is a nice wooden piece.  Earlier versions had a stand-up cardboard piece that you cut out.&#10;&#10;"
Wizard,Card Game,3,6,"Originated from Oh Hell! or &quot;Up and Down the River&quot; which are played with a standard deck of 52 cards. With a proprietary 60 card deck comprising a standard deck plus 4 Wizards (high) and 4 Jesters (low). In the first hand 1 card is dealt to each player. In the second 2 and so on. The game is over after the hand in which all cards are dealt.&#10;&#10;Trumps are determined by randomly showing a card from the rest of undealt pack, if the card is a Jester, NoTrump is played in the current round. If it is a wizard, the last player to bid gets to choose the trump, or choose to play NoTrump.&#10;&#10;After examining your cards you state the number of tricks you will win. Each round each player puts down one card. The first Wizard played wins the trick, followed by the highest trump card, followed by the highest card in the suit of the first card played.&#10;&#10;You get 20 points for correctly predicting how many tricks you will win, plus 10 points for each trick won. You lose 10 points for each trick over or under the amount you predicted.&#10;&#10;The game has plenty of luck inherent into it, especially at first (the first few rounds). Later rounds have very little luck, and because scoring increases over time (more cards are being dealt, so bids are higher), the overall game is a very skillful game.&#10;&#10;Good memory, counting, and knowledge of statistics are helpful in this game. &#10;[However, &quot;Wizard is pure fun, challenging, baffling and simply habit forming. Wizard is quickly becoming the most popular card game of the decade,&quot; according to the undated box. So presumably everyone can enjoy it, skilled or not.]&#10;&#10;This game can easily be played with a standard deck with some jesters and extra cards with the same backing, but has been sold in various formats over the years as a special deck with wizards and jesters added.  It differs from the games it originates from in that the typical format was to start at one card dealt and go up to the maximum amount, and then go back down again (in some versions this ordering is reversed and you start dealing the maximum amount down to one card, then back up).  Wizard shortens the game by starting at one card dealt and going up the maximum (which sometimes makes the last round have no trump since if the deck is divisible perfectly by the amount of players, there is no card to flip to determine trump in the last round).&#10;&#10;"
Hare & Tortoise,Animals,2,6,"As the first winner of the Spiel des Jahres award in 1979, Hare and Tortoise or the German Hase und Igel (for Hare and Hedgehog) will always be regarded as a classic game.  It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.  You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.  The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track.  It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.&#10;&#10;There have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare &amp; Tortoise by different publishers.  Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.&#10;&#10;&#10;      Parlett Strategic Variant--The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that &quot;... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn. This would be the equivalent of the hare taking a nap, as in Aesop's fable. This is the rule I most favour and would prefer it to simply not landing on them at all...&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Coloretto,Animals,2,5,"Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection. A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.&#10;&#10;Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is &plusmn;1 point, the second card is &plusmn;2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!&#10;&#10;A two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.&#10;&#10;"
To Court the King,Dice,2,5,"In this game, the players are petitioners at the royal court, trying to gain the King's favor. To do so, they must first gain the help of the servants and petty officials at the court, who can then help them gain access to the nobility, who, in turn, can help to reach the king.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. On their turn, a player will gather his dice, roll them, set aside at least one, and roll the remaining dice again, until all dice have been set aside. After that, he gets to select a character who will help him. Each character requires a certain combination of dice (such as two pairs or dice that show at least 30 points). The character will give the player some benefits on later rolls, such as an additional die or the ability to modify the results of a roll.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player gains the support of the Queen (and temporary favor of the King, winning ties in the final roll-off). Now, all players try to gain a dice result of as many equal dice as possible (7x 2s, 8x 6s, etc). The player who gets the longest, highest result gains the favor of the King and wins.&#10;&#10;Contents: 12 Dice, 60 character cards, 5 player aids, 1 marker, rules.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     BrettspielWelt (real-time)&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Giants,Ancient,3,5,"In this game, players incarnate clan leaders during the Golden Age of Easter Island. The board represents a simplified map of the island. Rock platforms (ahus) are where the Moa&iuml;s (monumental sculptures) will be erected.&#10;&#10;Your clan competes against others, and you will earn more prestige by building and transporting larger, more imposing Moa&iuml;s than your opponents' clans.&#10;&#10;Each of your pawns represents a group of men. You can grow your population if you wish. You will choose each turn which part of your population will sculpt Moa&iuml;s and which other part will transport them, in cooperation with other players.&#10;&#10;Statues are transported from the quarry to the ahus (the rock platforms) using paths made of pawns and the help of logs.&#10;&#10;You can use your influence (Tribal Markers) to choose the best statues and mark to your color the statues you cannot achieve in your turn. You can also rely on your Sorcerer and his mighty powers, of the strength of your Chief, as well as on mystic powers of the Rongo writing tablets.&#10;&#10;The winner will be the one who has erected the largest statues in the best places at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Note that there is a Official Rule Change for this game : For the final scoring, complete Rongo tablets are no longer scored and do not earn any points to the players.&#10;&#10;"
You're Bluffing!,Animals,3,5,"Classic bidding and bluffing game. The deck consists of sets of farm animals, 4 cards per animal. Players auction off the top animal of the deck, or try to complete their set by trading with another player. Highest bid wins, but auctioneer always has the choice to buy the animal for the same price as the highest bid.&#10;Trading is a blind bidding system: both players place their bid face down on the table and reveal them simultaneously to each other. High bidder gets the other player's animal. Both players swap their bid. It's best to bid just a little bit more than your opponent, but just how much did he bid?&#10;&#10;reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;Kuhhandel Master (2009)&#10;&#10;"
Medieval Merchant,Economic,2,6,"Players secure valued markets via affordable trade routes between medieval cities while simultaneously forcing opponents into less affordable and less valued markets.  The cities themselves have a variable number of spaces for players to develop business branches within, or alternatively establish new trade routes into wider reaching cities and towns.  Players may generate income and risk losing dominance over a city, or add branches within a city that lower the value of your product but can award you with a stronger market influence.  At the end of the game, the player with the most influence wins.&#10;&#10;"
King Arthur: The Card Game,Card Game,2,5,"Who will become the King's First Knight?&#10;&#10;Welcome to the world of King Arthur! As in the large board game, players in this legendary card game meet up with dangerous creatures and dark powers. As knights, they try to defeat their enemies, take part in jousts, and find the holy grail. Aside from power and prestige, they want one thing above all else: a seat at the right hand of King Arthur.&#10;&#10;"
Top Speed,Card Game,2,2,"Top Speed has two players racing to place their cards on eight rows. Cards have two attributes - color and icon. On each row, there can be only one card with each color and each icon. Once one of the players empties their hand, the game ends. Rows are scored (they are worth one to five points) so that the player who played the last card wins the row. If there's a mistake, the first player to make a mistake loses the row. The game is over in just few minutes.&#10;&#10;"
Ivanhoe,Card Game,2,5,"Take on the role of a knight and join the prestigious tournaments at the king's court. Use your cards to win the jousting competitions, and to fight with your sword, axe or morning-star. Rally your squires, gain the support of a maiden, and play action cards against your opponents.&#10;&#10;Clever use of action cards can change the type of tournament that is in progress. One card will 'unhorse' you, forcing everyone still in the jousting competition to switch to a weapon battle of the action card holder&rsquo;s choice.&#10;&#10;Other actions cause you to drop whatever other weapon you are using and resort to hand-to-hand battles in which the player with the most cards- not the highest point total- will win a token. Depending on the number of players in the game, the first player to win four or five different tournaments becomes the overall victor.&#10;&#10;There is a lot more strategy involved in the game than first meets the eye.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Attacke&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Dragon's Gold,Card Game,3,6,"In Dragon's Gold, each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they have only one goal: gold, silver, jewels and magic objects. As for actually killing a dragon? It's a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.&#10;&#10;As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sixty-second sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all of the dragons have been slain and the treasure claimed or discarded, the game ends and players score for their holdings, with silver and magic objects worth 1 point each, gold worth 3, the Black Diamond worth 7, and the colored gems scoring 10-15 points for those players who hold more than everyone else. (In the Advanced game, the colored gems score 8-12 points in addition to a variety bonus of 5 points for each set of different colored gems a player holds. The Black Diamond is worth 19 points [in the 2011 edition], but negates a player's score for all colored gems.)&#10;&#10;"
Trendy,Card Game,2,5,"In Trendy, each player plays cards representing various fashion designers.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you lay a card face up to the table and draw a new card.  When as many cards for a designer have been laid face up as the number on that designer's cards, that designer has a &quot;breakthrough&quot; and players who played that number save those cards for scoring at the end of the hand.  (The deck is balanced: more 7-value cards than 6-value cards, etc.)   All other played cards are discarded.&#10;&#10;There are 2 special cards for each designer in the deck:&#10;-  A Super Model is worth 2 cards toward achieving a breakthrough.&#10;-  An Out card clears all of that designer's face up cards.&#10;&#10;The game is played over several hands until at least one player has scored more than 100.&#10;&#10;"
Balloon Cup,Aviation / Flight,2,2,"In Balloon Cup, the players compete in several short balloon flights (hops) to collect the colored cubes associated with each hop. Four landscape cards &ndash; two plains alternating with two mountains &ndash; are laid out, and 1, 2, 3, or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added to these cards. From a hand of eight balloon cards, you must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent's side &ndash; a move that can really ruin the opponent's plans.&#10;&#10;High-valued balloons are played on the mountains, and low-valued balloons are played on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over &ndash; mountains becomes plains and vice-versa &ndash; and refilled with cubes. Five trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color. Players may even trade three otherwise useless cubes for one they can use. The first player to earn three trophy cards is the winner!&#10;&#10;"
Guillotine,Card Game,2,5,"The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game.  As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles.  Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.  However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting,' which is what makes the game interesting.  After three days worth of chopping, the highest total carries the day.&#10;&#10;"
Escape: The Curse of the Temple,Adventure,1,5,"Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.&#10;&#10;The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A cursed mask &ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.&#10;    A golden mask &ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.&#10;    A red torch or blue key &ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.&#10;    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.&#10;&#10;&#10;Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.&#10;&#10;The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&#10;&#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&#10;&#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &quot;Curses&quot; module, some tiles &quot;curse&quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!&#10;&#10;"
Trampelfanten,Animals,2,5,"Trampelfanten, or Stampeding Elephants, is a dice rolling game where players are racing elephants.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 6 elephants, 6 corresponding cards, 2 dice with coloured sides, a game board and instructions.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players each take a coloured elephants and its card representation. Any elephants left over are the maharaja's elephants. The cards remind the players which elephants are the maharaja's or the players.&#10;&#10;To move the pieces, players roll the coloured dice and heed the following rules: different colours - move those two elephants, same colours - move the elephant back one square. The next player has the choice to keep one of the dice or re-roll both.&#10;&#10;Elephants work their way to the end of the board until one reaches the turn square. When this happens, all elephants turn around to race back to the start.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there is only one elephant left on the track. If that elephant belongs to a player, he/she is the winner. If it is the maharaja's, the first player who made it back to the start is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is a re-theming of Das St&#195;&#182;rrische Muli&#10;&#10;"
Abenteuer im Wichtelwald,Mythology,2,4,"Despite its fairy tale theme, this is a fairly abstract game for 2-4 players Ages 8 and up. Each player tries to move their 6 gnomes from one side of the board to the other.&#10;&#10;For setup, the trees are placed on the game board, and the gnomes are placed on their starting spaces.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each player first moves a tree 1 space, then moves a gnome. Gnomes move in a straight line (orthogonally or diagonally) across empty spaces until they encounter an obstacle - a tree or a gnome. The gnome then does a 90 degree turn and keeps moving. If the gnome reaches its target space, and there is another gnome on it, the active player moves that gnome to another space on the board. The first player to move all their gnomes to their target space wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Hart an der Grenze,Bluffing,3,6,"In Hart an der Grenze (Close to the Border), players are people trying to cross a border with luggage full of legal and also illegal goods.&#10;&#10;Each one declares what he is carrying, but of course he only declares what the law allows (even if it means telling a lie).&#10;&#10;Each turn one of the players takes the role of sheriff. The sheriff must choose who to spot check.&#10;In case the sheriff picks someone whose luggage does not have exactly what was declared, the person must open the luggage and show his goods. The not-declared goods are lost and a fine is paid.&#10;However, before opening the luggage, the person may always suggest that the sheriff take some of his dollars so as to be kind and let him pass. If they come to an agreement, good for them!&#10;During the whole game, players may also stock goods for the end, when the border is closed and the price is doubled. But only a limited amount of each good can be sold at this time. And the bigger traders in each kind of good will have the advantage of selling first.&#10;&#10;To sum up, Hart an der Grenze is a game with bluffing, negotiation, strategy and a lot of good laughs.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Robin Hood&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Die Macher,Economic,3,5,"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;Die Macher is #1 in the Valley Games Classic Line&#10;&#10;"

The points are in the form of coins from 1 to 5 in worth forcing kids to actually do math (shudder).  The tiles is replaced after playing and if the white tile is drawn it allows the player to steal a tile from another player and the white tile is then replaced in the bag for others to possibly draw again in the future.&#10;&#10;For the younger kids it can teach color matching.

Shit!,Card Game,2,6,"It is a game where everyone simultaneously plays a unique number face down card a la Category 5 (6 Nimmt).&#10;&#10;There are 5 suits arranged in a circular pattern. The idea is you score the points based on the first person to hit their number traveling clockwise after the current number, e.g. if the colors are Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, etc. and the current target card is Orange 6, then the first number after orange 6 wins a number of points equal to the interval. For example, orange 7 would win 1 point, but if it were not there and Green 1 were next closest, it would win 5 points. If the next closest card were orange 5 (unlikely but possible), it would score 49 points.&#10;&#10;Each player also always has in hand a Shit! card which cannot score, but playing it is the only way to get another card in hand. Strategy comes from watching when people play cards and how many they have left. Time it right and you can play while everyone else is drawing for monster points.&#10;&#10;It's a fun 20 minutes. The rules are in English.&#10;&#10;"

A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;"

Chess,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typicially featuring games and commentary by chess masters.&#10;&#10;The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.&#10;&#10;"

The tower serves as a semi-permanent control marker, as well as a way to win.  If two land pieces are controlled by the same player, the land pieces are combined into one, which makes the position harder to take by the other players.&#10;&#10;The first player to place a set number of towers wins the game, but the game can also end when the land masses are reduced to three or fewer, in which case the player with the most towers placed wins.&#10;&#10;"

Babel,Ancient,2,2,"In Babel, each player makes use of members of various tribes of the ancient world to build temples, exploit (or exterminated) their opponent's work force, destroy or steal their opponent's temples and otherwise do whatever it takes to build the tallest temples to win the game.&#10;&#10;The game plays out on a small game board representing regions of 5 ancient civilizations, Medes, Sumerians, Hitites, Persians, and Assyrians.  Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.&#10;&#10;Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.

Odin's Ravens,Animals,2,2,"Each morning Odin sends the ravens Hugin and Munin to race over the world of Midgard and report back what they have seen. The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth.&#10;&#10;Odin's Ravens is a two-player card game in which two ravens race across separate tracks, the tracks being comprised of domino-style landscape cards that feature different types of land. Each player has his own deck of cards, using them to match cards to the land types in front of his raven and advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin Cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven. During play, each player can create an auxiliary stack, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future.&#10;&#10;The round ends when a raven reaches the end of the flight path, and that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points.

Take it Easy!,Abstract Strategy,1,8,"It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game, so take a look at the pictures! Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.&#10;&#10;The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.&#10;&#10;Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.&#10;&#10;"

On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play.

Pisa,Card Game,3,5,"from Schloesser session report:&#10;&#10;This is a  trick-taking game, but with enough twists to give it a very different feel. Before each hand, players bid, one at a time, to determine three factors which will affect the hand:&#10;&#10;a) trump colors (primary &amp; secondary) &#10;b) most or fewest tricks &#10;c) whether zero is considered 'high' or 'low'&#10;&#10;Bidding is done by playing cards face-down from your hand. Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.&#10;&#10;After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points. After a hand is completed, the entire process is repeated, including the bidding phase. A number of rounds equal to the number of players is played, with the player accumulating the greatest number of victory points being the victor.&#10;&#10;"

Victory points are cumulative from round to round, so a fast start yields a big advantage.&#10;&#10;Each turn, each player places a card from his hand face down, then all cards are simultaneously revealed. The cards show the buildings that the players want to build that round; building costs are paid for by discarding other cards. Some buildings provide income at the end of the round in the form of new cards, with certain buildings increasing the income provided by others; similarly, some buildings boost the VPs provided by others, with a University, for example, being worth one more VP for each School you have in play.&#10;&#10;Certain buildings have symbols on them &ndash; car, fountain, shopping cart - and the income and VPs provided by some buildings depends on how many symbols you have in play; the Autobahn, for example, is worth one dollar (i.e., card) and one VP for each car symbol you control.&#10;&#10;"
Circus Flohcati,Card Game,3,5,"In this light, fun filler players try to complete sets of cards before the game ends.  A player begins her turn with several face-up cards to choose from.  If she doesn&rsquo;t like them, she can draw another, but if a card gets turned that matches the suit of one of the face-up cards, she loses her turn.  She can continue drawing until she likes one or it matches. Also during her turn she can combine three cards of the same value and lay them down in front of her.  Such sets will be worth 10 points at the end of the game; additionally, the highest card from each suit in her hand contributes its face value to her score.&#10;&#10;"
Sentinels of the Multiverse,Card Game,1,5,"A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions. An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse!&#10;&#10;Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments.&#10;&#10;Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which &quot;play themselves&quot;, requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.&#10;&#10;"
It's Mine!,Card Game,3,5,"From the publisher's web site:&#10;&#10;It's this simple - watch the cards the dealer lays down. When you like what you see, hit the &quot;It's Mine!&quot; board and grab them all. The catch? Somebody else may want the same cards you do. The first one to slam the board claims the cards. Most cards are good, but some aren't. &quot;Double or Nothing&quot; cards only count if you claim a pair of them. &quot;Toast or Most&quot; cards only score if you have the most of them, and &quot;Jackpot&quot; cards score jackpot points depending on how many you get. IT'S MINE! is great fun for Ages 7 and up. Kids are quick - so adults be on your toes!&#10;&#10;"
Rum & Pirates,Dice,2,5,"Rum and Pirates is a relatively simple movement and collection game, known in German as Um Ru(h)m und Ehre (For Rum/Renown and Honor). The game was designed by Stefan Feld and is for 2-5 players ages 9 and up and plays in 60-75 minutes. On the Alea complexity scale of 1 (simple) to 10 (difficult), this game rates a 2. (Editor's Note: That is the same complexity as Chinatown, Wyatt Earp, and Edel, Stein & Reich)&#10;&#10;The players take on the roles of freebooters who, back in their pirates' hideout, spend their time with all kinds of competitions - drinking, fighting, etc. All players move the main playing figure, the captain, through the alleys of the village, with the goal of gaining as much rum and reknown as possible. The end of each of the five rounds is also marked by a highly variable fight to claim the best sleeping spaces on board the ship (bed or board?). The game is a mixture of tactics, strategy, and luck. The die plays an important role in the game, but you still get the feeling of being at the mercy of fate only rarely.&#10;&#10;The game contains 76 plastic pirate figures, 9 game board pieces that ensure the board is always different, about 200 tiles, and 1 die.&#10;&#10;Description adapted from the Gamewire Essen Preview.&#10;&#10;This game is #10 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;"
The Bucket King,Animals,2,6,"Card game with unusual scoring. Players play sets of animal cards trying to knock over each other's pyramids of buckets. Cards in hand can be used to attack and defend their colour buckets, taking out lower buckets causes cascades.&#10;&#10;The deck is five colours (farm animals) numbered 1-8, with two 1s and two 8s. Players start with 12 cards.  The start player plays 1-3 cards of one colour, giving a total sum. This total attacks the player to their left, who either plays 1-3 cards of the same colour totalling higher to defend, or loses a bucket. If they do defend though, that total then attacks the player to their left and so on, round the table. If it gets back to the start player, then can add 1-3 more cards to their original play, increasing the total. At some point, a player cannot defend, and buckets go tumbling. If you match the total attacking you this reverses the direction of play, meaning the cards already played are being added to additional cards to create high totals.&#10;&#10;Players look at their starting hand before building their pyramid o' buckets, so it pays to put your weak colours at the top.&#10;&#10;If you play a cards or cards, you draw back only one card from the draw deck. If you forget, tough! The game ends when a pre-set number of players lose all their buckets, the number increases with the number playing. The player with the most remaining is the winner.&#10;&#10;A game comes with enough buckets for 6 players, but you can play with multiple sets to allow larger groups to play. This works well as action down the far end of the table means you are safe, while the reversal mechanism means that there can be a build up of a lead to an unmatchable number before it breaks out of that end of the table.&#10;&#10;Seemingly a game of luck, but noticable that the same players keep winning and with experience the winning margins keep getting reduced.&#10;&#10;"
Mastermind,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"Guess the color of hidden pegs.  A deduction game where each player takes turn making a limited number of guesses, using logic to deduce what pegs the opponent has hidden.&#10;&#10;One player secretly puts four colored pegs in the spaces behind a screen at once end of the game board. The other player, the code breaker, makes a series of guesses. After each guess, the code maker uses smaller pegs to tell the code breaker if their guessed pegs are the right color and in the right place, are the right color but the wrong place, or are the wrong color entirely. The code breaker makes another guess in the next row, building upon information from previous guesses, trying to match the pegs the code maker hid at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player game with 4 holes. For other combinations, please see the Mastermind family.&#10;&#10;"

Crokinole,Action / Dexterity,2,4,"This game is like shuffleboard in the round.  Players take turns flicking disks on a board, trying to score points by attaining central regions.  The main stipulation being that contact with the other teams' pieces must be made in order for the disk to remain on the board afterward.  Although the game uses quite a bit of skill to flick the disks, there's a very significant strategy element to the game.  There are many different variants and rules, as this game is very old and has had many different incarnations over the years.&#10;&#10;"
Katzenjammer Blues,Card Game,2,6,"Katzenjammer Blues is an unusual hybrid of rummy and auction rules, with a couple of strange ideas thrown in about the game ending once 20 points, total, have been scored, and a 5-point penalty for most jokers.

Celebrities,Humor,4,30,"Celebrities is a public domain game in which each player writes the names of celebrities (about 8) on pieces of paper or cards, one per piece of paper or card.  The names are placed in a container, and players are assigned partners randomly (there must be an even number of players).&#10;&#10;The first player pulls names out of the container one at a time and tries to get their partner to say the name on the paper by giving whatever clues they like, without saying the actual name on the paper.  If their partner get a name right, they keep the paper; everything else goes back in the container.  Each player has only 30 seconds.  The names are passed to the next person, who repeats the process, and so on, with the names going around the table, and everyone getting chances to give clues and to guess, until all of the names are guessed.  Teams score one point for each name guessed.  All of the names are put back in the container, and a second round begins.&#10;&#10;In the second round, the clue giver can give only one word clues for each name (with whatever other sounds or charades they like), and the guesser can guess only once.  The round is played similar to the first round in everything else, and the names go back to the container at the end again, for a third round.&#10;&#10;In the third round, no words at all are allowed for the clue giver; only charades and sounds (humming tunes) is allowed.&#10;&#10;The team with the highest total score from the three rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was packaged commercially as Celebrity in 1999, and later with pre-printed cards as Time's Up! and WTactics.&#10;&#10;"
China,Ancient,3,5,"China is an abstracted game of political influence in China. Players use cards to place pieces (Houses or Emissaries) into the nine regions on the board. When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for majorities of houses in that region. At game end, players then score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board.&#10;&#10;This fascinating game of domination combines multiple tactical possibilities with simple-to-learn rules and a short playing time!&#10;&#10;Even today in China, the unmistakable evidence of a fascinating story is everywhere. Hundreds of years ago, the country teetered on the brink of a change in power. Regional rulers fought continuously with each other with only one goal in mind: to become the new Emperor. They erected imposing houses and sent their emissaries to the regional courts.&#10;&#10;China is based on the award-winning game Web of Power by master game designer Michael Schacht. China differs from Web of Power in that there is no &quot;half-time&quot; scoring of regions as there is in the earlier game; there are four face-up cards to draw from instead of just two; and all adjacent regions have Emissary scoring opportunities, whereas in Web of Power, some adjacent regions did not. &#10;A special variant with fortifications is included.&#10;&#10;Aside from these differences, the two games are essentially the same.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.boardgames-online.net (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;implemented bonus maps: Web of Power, Hellenia, Skandinavia, America, AD 850, Life on Mars, Big in Japan&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Web of Power&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    China - Das Duell (Two-player variant)&#10;    China Erweiterung&#10;    China: Grenzstreitigkeiten&#10;    China Einflusskarten&#10;    China: The Embassies&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Hang on Harvey!,Action / Dexterity,2,2,"The object of the game is to be the first player to get any part of his Harvey to hang below the bottom edge of the playing field.  Players simultaneously race each other in lowering their Harvey by removing one peg from the playing field and placing it somewhere below Harvey so that when you remove another peg Harvey will fall onto your other remaining pegs.  If your Harvey falls all the way to the bottom, then you have to start again from the top.  Beginners play with 4 pegs, while advanced players use 3.&#10;&#10;"
Strand-Cup,Card Game,4,8,"A card game about beach volleyball for four, six, or eight players, competing in two teams. Cards represent all of the normal plays in volleyball, such as forearm pass, spike, block, dive, etc. Players work in teams, playing cards to send the ball over the net. Combinations of cards can be played to make it more difficult for the opposing team to respond. The opposing team must then play cards to receive the ball and send it back over the net. Play continues until one team is unable to return the ball over the net. Players then re-fill their hand and begin a new point.&#10;&#10;The normal rules of volleyball apply, such as only the side serving can score and a player can't hit the ball (play a card) 2 times in succession. Quick-playing with the feeling of a real volleyball match.&#10;&#10;"
Prosperity,Economic,2,4,"You're the leader of a great nation which is currently expanding. Over the course of the seven decades covered by the game, you will have to invest in infrastructures and industries, provide your country with energy and finance the mercurial forces of research in order to remain competitive.&#10;&#10;But prosperity has a price. You owe it to future generations to leave them a healthy world. Pollution lurks, but will you be able to limit it?&#10;&#10;Prosperity has players building up their countries on a grand but abstract scale, with them needing to balance concerns over energy and ecology with the constant need for capital and the long-term goal of prosperity points.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 24 tiles available, half on the energy side of the shared game board and half on the ecology side. Two tiles on each side are placed on levels 1-6, with the players each having two research markers &ndash; energy and ecology &ndash; that start at level 1. Each player has an individual game board with color-coded spaces for tiles, a pollution track, and tracks for energy and ecology. A stack of 36 tiles &ndash; with tiles arranged by decades: the six from 2030 on the bottom, then the five from 2020, and so on to the five from 1970 &ndash; is set up during the playing area.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top tile from the stack, then everyone resolves the symbol highlighted on the tile:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Energy &ndash; for a positive value, earn money; for a negative value, lose money or increase your pollution&#10;    Ecology &ndash; remove or add discs to your pollution track&#10;    Capital &ndash; earn money for each capital symbol on the tiles you own&#10;    Research &ndash; advance one research marker one space for each research symbol on tiles you own&#10;    Prosperity &ndash; score points for each prosperity symbol on tiles you own, but only if your pollution isn't maxed out&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has done this, the active player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take money.&#10;    Remove one pollution marker.&#10;    Move forward one space on one research track.&#10;    Buy a tile, with the amount owed being based on whether the tile is energy or ecology and the level of your corresponding research marker. If you buy a tile of the same level, the cost is &euro;100; if the tile is of a higher level, you pay &euro;100, plus &euro;100 for each level; and if the tile is lower, you pay a flat &euro;50.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players have limited space for tiles on their individual boards, especially since the tiles and spaces are color-coded, but players can cover existing tiles, if desired, losing any benefits (or penalties) in the process. Some parts of the individual board are off-limits to new infrastructure until you first provide transport; toll roads, highways and even train systems have drawbacks of their own, but ideally you'll be able to build your way past those trouble spots without causing too much pollution.&#10;&#10;When the final tile is drawn, that player finishes his turn, then everyone scores: twice for their energy and ecology levels, one for capital (with money being converted into prosperity points), once for research on both tracks (with points for those researching the most), and once for prosperity. Whoever tallies the most prosperity points wins!&#10;&#10;"
Sushi Express,Card Game,3,6,"The players pilot their maneuverable, little delivery cars around the city in order to serve as many customers as possible. When you pass by in your Sushi Express, you may choose a customer card. When doing so, you&rsquo;d like to get as many different types of cards as possible, as that&rsquo;s how you get the most victory points. But don&rsquo;t ignore the tips - whoever has the least at the end of the game gets minus points.&#10;&#10;"
In the Shadow of the Emperor,Medieval,2,4,"In the Shadow of the Emperor is a tactical game for 2-4 players. Players represent aristocratic families at the Court of the Holy Roman Emperor. Players seek to get their family members into influential positions with the various electorships of the Empire. Once there they accumulate votes towards being elected to be Holy Roman Emperor. Players choose actions for their family members to take, which allow them to wrest control of the various Elector States (each of which has a special ability in addition to its voting power) whilst displacing their opponents. However, family members age and die and the number of action cards is limited, restricting the tactical options. As players build their influence they collect victory points and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"
Santiago,Farming,3,5,"This game is about cultivating and watering fields. To accomplish this, a number of tiles denoting various plantation types come into the game each round.  The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile&rsquo;s yield will be.  Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round.  The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money.  The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like.  Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground.  At game&rsquo;s end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type &ndash; the bigger the better.  But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players.&#10;&#10;"
Agricola,Animals,1,5,"Description from BoardgameNews&#10;&#10;In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.&#10;&#10;"
A Dog's Life,Adventure,2,6,"The object of the game is for a dog to locate four bones and carry them safely back to his home.   Bones tend to be found in trash cans and are sometimes given as rewards for successfully delivering newspapers to various establishments.  Players must also pay close attention to their bellies as their hunger level drops with each passing round.  So, finding food is also a top priority.&#10;&#10;Life on the streets is tough as not only must players search for food and bones, but they also must fend off rival dogs and that pesky dog catcher.&#10;&#10;"
Timbuktu,Deduction,3,5,"In this game each player takes the role of a caravan leader. The number of camels within a caravan depends on he number of players. Each camel is loaded with a lot of goods, and the goal of the game is to carry all the goods from the starting position to the final oasis: Timbuktu.&#10;&#10;However, during the course of this journey, the caravans stop at other oases. Once all camels arrive to an oasis- and the night comes- thieves attack the caravan, and steal different goods. While moving from one oasis to another, players receive different clues about the manner of the thefts. Each player has a different clue, and although clues are passed around, one player  only, receives three of the total five clues. From the action of the other players &ndash; caravan leaders -, the clues have to be guessed and camels have to be relocated, in order to save all the goods from the thieves.&#10;&#10;The next morning, the caravan continues it's way towards Timbuktu, and players are challenged with different clues again.

Paletti too had little money, but instead he had a marvelous plan. Why buy new columns when he could re-use the old ones that his Grandfather had built?  All he needed to do was remove some of those holding up the first floor, of which there were far too many in any case, and rebuild them further up, so that they could support new floors,  reaching up towards the skies!&#10;&#10;&quot;Excellent, Paletti&quot; shouted his friends, and they quickly started to work.  Soon they had a marvelous building in front of them, the &quot;Villa Paletti&quot;. Nowadays, no one knows what it was caused the collapse of the Vila Paletti, perhaps a puff of wind, or a slight earth tremor, but all the experts are united on one point, that Paletti,  far ahead of his time, was the first to discover something whose full importance is only now starting to become clear to us, the Euro pallet!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Palazzo Paletti&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
SET,Card Game,1,20,"In SET, each card contains 1-3 objects, with all of the objects on a card having the same color, shape and shading, e.g., two purple shaded ovals. Colors, shapes, and shadings come in three different types: green, purple and red; oval, diamond and squiggle; and solid, shaded and outlined.&#10;&#10;All players compete simultaneously and try to claim sets of cards in a single pass through the deck. A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute. For example, if all three cards have the same number of objects, but three different shapes, shadings, and colors, then those cards are a set; if two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set.&#10;&#10;To play, one person takes the deck and lays out twelve cards face up. The first person to spot a set collects those three cards; if the player was mistaken, then this player cannot claim a set until after another player has done so. After someone has claimed a set, the cardholder lays out three more cards. (If all players agree that no sets can be claimed, then the cardholder lays out three more cards. These cards aren't replaced after someone claims a set.) Whoever claims the most sets wins!&#10;&#10;"
Am Fuß des Kilimandscharo,Racing,2,4,"Simple Knizia game for children. Progress up the trail to the foot of Kilimanjaro by playing numbered cards. You can play cards in front of yourself to make 3 piles, or onto your opponents to slow them down if they're ahead of you on the trail. The cards are in different types (colors), canoe, mule, jeep or by foot. If your 3 cards are the same type, you can move the total. If 2 cards match, you can move that total. If the 3 cards don't match, you can move the highest number.&#10;&#10;In addition, there are chance tokens laid on the trail face-down. These are revealed as you reach them; the banana is a meal-break (take another move), a lion is danger (fall back to the last village), or a swap tile lets you switch places on the trail with another player.&#10;&#10;The player that reaches the mountain first wins, but if the players exhaust their decks, then the furthest along the trail is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.&#10;&#10;Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.&#10;&#10;Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.&#10;&#10;"
Fresco,Renaissance,2,4,"In Fresco, players are master painters working to restore a fresco in a Renaissance church.&#10;&#10;Each round begins with players deciding what time they would like to wake up for the day. The earlier you wake up, the earlier you will be in turn order, and the better options you will be guaranteed to have. Wake up early too often, however, and your apprentices will become unhappy and stop working as efficiently. They would much rather sleep in!&#10;&#10;Then, players decide their actions for the turn, deploying their apprentice work force to various tasks. You'll need to buy paint, mix paint, work on painting the fresco, raise money (which you'll need to buy the aforementioned paint!) by painting portraits, and perhaps even send your apprentices to the opera in order to increase their happiness. Points are scored mostly by painting the fresco, which requires specific combinations of paints, so you'll need to buy and mix your paints wisely, in addition to beating other players to the paints and fresco segments you would like to paint.&#10;&#10;Fresco includes several expansion modules, so you can play without expansions for a lighter family game or add in expansions to vary play and increase the decision-making and difficulty, resulting in a very flexible game with a high replay value.&#10;&#10;"
Oasis,Civilization,3,5,"You are the head of a Mongolian family, intent on becoming the most powerful in the land. Use your resources wisely to take control of fertile steppe lands to raise horses, build sacred temples, develop caravans of camels, and control the beautiful oases. The player with the most points at the end of the game will be anointed the Noble of the Oasis.&#10;&#10;"
Antike,Ancient,2,6,"From the publisher's website:&#10;Antike is a challenging strategy game about evolution and competition among ancient civilizations. Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided. Players choose from Greeks, Romans, and Germanic tribes and Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Persians, Arabs, Egyptians, and Babylonians.&#10;&#10;Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first will win the game!&#10;&#10;Lead one of these nations to victory! But watch out for your enemies, as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples. The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy.&#10;&#10;"
RoboRally,Miniatures,2,8,"Imagine that you're a supercomputer.  Now imagine that you're bored.  So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies.  Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory.  The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera.  But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;"
Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game,Aviation / Flight,2,4,"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game is a tactical ship-to-ship combat game in which players take control of powerful Rebel X-wings and nimble Imperial TIE fighters, facing them against each other in fast-paced space combat. Featuring stunningly detailed and painted miniatures, the X-Wing Miniatures Game recreates exciting Star Wars space combat throughout its several included scenarios. Select your crew, plan your maneuvers, and complete your mission!&#10;&#10;Whatever your chosen vessel, the rules of X-Wing facilitate fast and visceral gameplay that puts you in the middle of Star Wars fiercest firefights. Each ship type has its own unique piloting dial, which is used to secretly select a speed and maneuver each turn. After planning maneuvers, each ship's dial is revealed and executed (starting with the lowest skilled pilot). So whether you rush headlong toward your enemy showering his forward deflectors in laser fire, or dance away from him as you attempt to acquire a targeting lock, you'll be in total control throughout all the tense dogfighting action.&#10;&#10;Star Wars: X-Wing features (three) unique missions, and each has its own set of victory conditions and special rules; with such a broad selection of missions, only clever and versatile pilots employing a range of tactics will emerge victorious. What's more, no mission will ever play the same way twice, thanks to a range of customization options, varied maneuvers, and possible combat outcomes. Damage, for example, is determined through dice and applied in the form of a shuffled Damage Deck. For some hits your fighter sustains, you'll draw a card that assigns a special handicap. Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy? Perhaps an ill-timed weapon malfunction will limit your offensive capabilities. Or worse yet, your pilot could be injured, compromising his ability to focus on the life-and-death struggle in which he is engaged...&#10;&#10;The Star Wars: X-Wing starter set includes everything you need to begin your battles, such as scenarios, cards, and fully assembled and painted ships. What's more, Star Wars: X-Wing's quick-to-learn ruleset establishes the foundation for a system that can be expanded with your favorite ships and characters from the Star Wars universe.&#10;&#10;"
Tumblin-Dice,Action / Dexterity,1,4,"A dexterity dice game consisting of four sets of colored dice one either slides, rolls, or flicks down a stepped surface. Usually one slides the die for better accuracy.  After each person has slid their 4 dice, points are scored.  You score the die roll times a multiplier of either 1&times;, 2&times;, 3&times;, or 4&times; depending on which area of the board the die is on.  (Dice which land in the 0&times; region are immediately removed from play.)  High scoring rolls are targets for opponents.  Four rounds are played and the player with the most points win.&#10;&#10;Tumblin-Dice Jr. is the &quot;travel&quot; version.&#10;&#10;The 2008 edition from Ferti Games states is for 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;"
Connect Four,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"Connect 4 is a well known vertical game played with &quot;checkers&quot; (it is more akin to Tic Tac Toe or Go Moku).&#10;&#10;The board is placed in the stand to hold it vertically and the players drop checkers into one of the 7 slots, each of which holds 6 of the &quot;checker's&quot; men, until one player succeeds in getting 4 in a row--horizontally, vertically or diagonally.&#10;&#10;The game is actually non-proprietary and nicer adult versions can be found under the name The Captain's Mistress.&#10;&#10;"
Hexagony,Abstract Strategy,2,6,"This game was originally published by the designer as Bin'Fa under the company name Taoist Arts, Inc. It was released a few years later as Hexagony by Avalon Hill, and then again as Bin'Fa by the designer under the company name Kenterprises. The Avalon Hill version has slightly different rules. Alan Moon is credited with development of this version. Bin'Fa will be re-released February 2015 after undergoing numerous alterations and rule changes from its previous incarnations.&#10;&#10;Bin'Fa/2015 Edition is described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;Bin&rsquo;Fa is a game of strategy for 2 to 6 players, each of whom controls an army of twelve units, a general and a supply pawn. In multiple army games, each player controls either two or three armies. The object of the game is to capture the opposing army units by surrounding them, thereby removing them from play.&#10;&#10;The game board is divided into six separate triangles, which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game. Each player places his armies at the start of the game in his home battle sector. The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.&#10;&#10;The terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.&#10;&#10;Bin&acute;Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.&#10;&#10;One of the most exciting aspects of Bin&acute;Fa is the &quot;cavalry charge.&quot; As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.&#10;&#10;The game of Bin&acute;Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times. Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese general and student of warfare. Bin&acute;Fa is based on the precepts contained in his classic work on the subject, &quot;The Art of War,&quot; written 2,300 years ago. They provide the structural framework for the game.&#10;&#10;"

Leapfrog,Bluffing,1,6,"Leapfrog is a fun, family game simple enough for younger gamers to play but with sufficient depth to interest seasoned gamers. The game is played over three races : a fast race,  a slow race  and &lt;gulp&gt; a brave race . Each player acts simultaneously so there is no downtime between turns. Race order and tadpole tokens mean that you will still have a chance of winning even going into the last race. Points are scored depending on race position  but also for collecting tadpoles. Remember, only frogs that have not had their legs eaten can win the game !&#10;&#10;"
Rolling Japan,Dice,1,99,"Rolling Japan is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of Japan that's divided into the 47 prefectures, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild purple die. All players now write down each number rolled on any prefecture of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue prefecture and a 2 in one yellow prefecture. If the purple die is rolled, you can place this number in a prefecture of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-purple die as any color. However, neighboring prefectures &mdash; including those in different areas connected by blue lines &mdash; can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a prefecture of the appropriate color. (If all the prefectures in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&#10;&#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round. After eight rounds the game ends, and whoever has the fewest Xs on her map wins.&#10;&#10;"
Ace of Aces: Powerhouse Series,Aviation / Flight,2,2,The Powerhouse Series book set pits the Fokker DVII of Georg von Hantlemann against the SPAD XIII of Eddie Rickenbacker. The game provides statistics for several other WWI fighter planes that may be played using this set.&#10;&#10;The Powerhouse books include a different variety of maneuvers than was used in the Handy Rotary books making for interesting match-ups between the two sets.&#10;&#10;
