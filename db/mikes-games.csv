6 nimmt!,Card Game,2,10,"In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;"
A Dog's Life,Adventure,2,6,"The object of the game is for a dog to locate four bones and carry them safely back to his home.   Bones tend to be found in trash cans and are sometimes given as rewards for successfully delivering newspapers to various establishments.  Players must also pay close attention to their bellies as their hunger level drops with each passing round.  So, finding food is also a top priority.&#10;&#10;Life on the streets is tough as not only must players search for food and bones, but they also must fend off rival dogs and that pesky dog catcher.&#10;&#10;"
Abenteuer im Wichtelwald,Mythology,2,4,"Despite its fairy tale theme, this is a fairly abstract game for 2-4 players Ages 8 and up. Each player tries to move their 6 gnomes from one side of the board to the other.&#10;&#10;For setup, the trees are placed on the game board, and the gnomes are placed on their starting spaces.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each player first moves a tree 1 space, then moves a gnome. Gnomes move in a straight line (orthogonally or diagonally) across empty spaces until they encounter an obstacle - a tree or a gnome. The gnome then does a 90 degree turn and keeps moving. If the gnome reaches its target space, and there is another gnome on it, the active player moves that gnome to another space on the board. The first player to move all their gnomes to their target space wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Ace of Aces: Handy Rotary Series,Aviation / Flight,2,2,"Ace of Aces is an innovative 1-on-1 combat game that simulates a dogfight between WWI aircraft. Each player has a book with pictures of what they see out the cockpit of their airplane. Each player selects a maneuver (bank left, barrel roll, etc.) and tells their opponent a page number to turn to. This new page, when cross indexed with the maneuver made, gives the page number that shows the results of the chosen maneuver. The object of the game is to get your opponent in your sights and shoot them down.&#10;&#10;There are advanced rules for fuel consumption as well as a campaign game.&#10;&#10;"
Ace of Aces: Powerhouse Series,Aviation / Flight,2,2,The Powerhouse Series book set pits the Fokker DVII of Georg von Hantlemann against the SPAD XIII of Eddie Rickenbacker. The game provides statistics for several other WWI fighter planes that may be played using this set.&#10;&#10;The Powerhouse books include a different variety of maneuvers than was used in the Handy Rotary books making for interesting match-ups between the two sets.&#10;&#10;
Adam & Eva,Card Game,2,2,"A description of the game from Ravensburger:&#10;&#10;In this paradise of a card game, two players take part in a very special competition: who will pick the nicest fruits from the forbidden Tree of Knowledge? It sounds easier than it is, since your opponent decides what happens to your cards.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Ravensburger Fun For 2 Series.&#10;&#10;"
Advanced Civilization,Ancient,2,8,"This is an expansion for Civilization. Included are more civilization advancements (both quantity and type), which give the players new options for advancement, as well as a slightly restructured commodity trading round, which has new resources and disasters to be traded. The most significant aspect of the game is a restructuring of the advancement/victory conditions, which removes the limits on advancement cards.  Some claim this makes the strategies more homogenous, while others claim the reverse is true.&#10;&#10;The use of the word &quot;Advanced&quot; to describe this expansion is somewhat misleading.  The original Civilization game was already time-consuming and moderately difficult, and the expansion is a reworking of the original game, rather than an additive expansion.  Some rules simplify and make the game easier, while other rules like the expanded technology tree are more complex.&#10;&#10;"
Agricola,Animals,1,5,"Description from BoardgameNews&#10;&#10;In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.&#10;&#10;"
Aladdin's Dragons,Arabian,3,5,"After the immediate response to Richard Breese's Keydom at Essen 1999, Hans im Gl&#195;&#188;ck Verlags-GmbH contracted to take the basic game idea and produce a version of the game.  Aladdin's Dragons, or Morgenland in the original German, is the product of their cooperation.&#10;&#10;The game features players putting numbered bidding chips face-down onto the board sequentially.  After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved.  The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game.  The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players' actions.  The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 2001.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Keydom&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Aladdin's Dragons (card game version by same name as board game)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Microbadges:    (Buy One)&#10;&#10;      Aladdin's Dragons fan&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Alexandros,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"Alexandros is an abstract strategy by Leo Colovini, thematically inspired by the military expansion of Alexander the Great. It includes the &quot;triggered scoring for all&quot; mechanism, which can be considered a trademark of the designer, implemented in many of his games. It forces players to evaluate their actions in relation to what other players can earn.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have more points than other players when the trail/border markers are depleted or someone scores 100 points first.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is driven by cards, used for all actions. Clockwise, players are first obliged to move the figure representing Alexandros across a triangular grid. They do this by playing cards with symbols matching those on destination spots. This is the core concept of the game - when the figure of Alexandros is moved, it leaves a trail of borders behind it. Soon, these borders begin to form provinces composed of triangular spaces: either with symbols or empty.&#10;&#10;After moving Alexandros, players either build their hand of cards by drawing them, take over provinces or trigger scorings if the situation on the board suits them.&#10;&#10;Players can occupy provinces by playing cards from their hand and placing tokens representing their leaders on spaces with corresponding symbols. When a scoring is triggered, provinces earn points equal to the number of empty spaces in them. Players can take over empty provinces and/or those occupied by other players. Each player has only four generals and placing them costs valuable cards - the game requires careful hand management and point-to-point movement - to create worthy provinces for scoring.&#10;&#10;Awarded title of &quot;Best Family Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 2005.&#10;&#10;"
Alibi,Card Game,2,5,"In each round, four suspect cards are placed face up on the table. Players attempt to &quot;prove&quot; which suspect is the real criminal by playing evidence cards - cards that match the clothing worn by the suspect. A suspect is confirmed as a criminal when five different evidence cards matching the suspect are played, or when the other three suspects have been eliminated by having alibi cards played on them. Players receive a bonus for playing evidence matching the one true criminal and receive bonuses for being the one to capture a criminal. The game ends when all suspects have been captured, and the winner is the player who has accumulated the most points.&#10;&#10;"
Am Fuß des Kilimandscharo,Racing,2,4,"Simple Knizia game for children. Progress up the trail to the foot of Kilimanjaro by playing numbered cards. You can play cards in front of yourself to make 3 piles, or onto your opponents to slow them down if they're ahead of you on the trail. The cards are in different types (colors), canoe, mule, jeep or by foot. If your 3 cards are the same type, you can move the total. If 2 cards match, you can move that total. If the 3 cards don't match, you can move the highest number.&#10;&#10;In addition, there are chance tokens laid on the trail face-down. These are revealed as you reach them; the banana is a meal-break (take another move), a lion is danger (fall back to the last village), or a swap tile lets you switch places on the trail with another player.&#10;&#10;The player that reaches the mountain first wins, but if the players exhaust their decks, then the furthest along the trail is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Antike,Ancient,2,6,"From the publisher's website:&#10;Antike is a challenging strategy game about evolution and competition among ancient civilizations. Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided. Players choose from Greeks, Romans, and Germanic tribes and Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Persians, Arabs, Egyptians, and Babylonians.&#10;&#10;Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves.

Apples to Apples,Card Game,4,10,"The party game Apples to Apples consists of two decks of cards: Things and Descriptions. Each round, the active player draws a Description card (which features an adjective like &quot;Hairy&quot; or &quot;Smarmy&quot;) from the deck, then the other players each secretly choose the Thing card in hand that best matches that description and plays it face-down on the table. The active player then reveals these cards and chooses the Thing card that, in his opinion, best matches the Description card, which he awards to whoever played that Thing card. This player becomes the new active player for the next round.&#10;&#10;Once a player has won a pre-determined number of Description cards, that player wins.&#10;&#10;"
Around the World in 80 Days,Novel-based,2,6,"Following in Jules Verne's footsteps, players attempt to travel around the world in 80 days on a map with Victorian-era decorations.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he chooses one of the face-up travel cards. Each card comes with an extra (getting to be first player in the next round, for example). Then he decides whether to travel to the next city. Does he want to wait until the next round in hopes of better cards, or will he make his journey now? If so, he must have and play the required travel cards. The two transportation types are trains and ships. For example, 2 ship cards are required to travel from Suez to Bombay, so 2 ship cards must be played; train cards won't help in this instance. Time is spent each step of the way in the form of days, and (while meeting certain other requirements) the winner is the player who spends the fewest number of days getting around the world. The number of days depends on the travel cards used, plus help from special cards, hindrance from the meandering detective, and so on.&#10;&#10;"

Australia,Aviation / Flight,2,5,"A board game for 2-5 players. Each player controls a group of Rangers, who are working on nature and industry projects in Australia during the 1920s. The game board shows 6 states, which are divided into 24 land or water regions. Every region contains a face down industrial counter and a face up nature counter. On the borders, you find bases (camps or ships), where the players place their Ranger pieces to score points. At the beginning, every player receives a number of Rangers, which he keeps on his own player board, a plane, and two cards. The back of a card shows how many Rangers you can place in a base and how many dollars you receive. The front of a card shows the region where this base should border on.&#10;&#10;The active player must perform two actions from the following three possibilities:&#10;1) A player may fly his plane to a region and turn up an industry counter (if available). &#10;2) A player may play a card to collect money and/or place Rangers in one base. Should this card have the same color as the region where his plane is, placement is free. Otherwise, a fee of $3 is collected from the player.&#10;3) A player may remove up to four Rangers from the game board back to his or her supply. &#10;Note: A special move is allowed to move any Ranger on the board for a cost of $4.&#10;&#10;You score points by completing nature or industrial projects. Nature projects are completed as soon as the last free base in this region contains at least 1 Ranger. The player who completes the project receives 3 bonus points. Every player with Rangers in a base in this region receives 1 point for every Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Industrial projects are completed as soon as the industry counter is turned over and the surrounding bases contain the required number of Rangers. These projects also provide 3 bonus points and 1 point per Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Points are registered on a scoring track. At the end of the game, each dollar is an extra victory point.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all card piles are exhausted and at least one player has played his last card. The players add their remaining dollars to their scores. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Note: the English rules for the basic game may have an errata. It says draw 9 cards to make stacks, when the non-English rules say draw 8 cards, and the Advanced English rules say draw 9 instead of 8 cards.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules&#10;&#10;A windmill is introduced. When an industry counter with a windmill symbol is turned over, the windmill moves to another region and will add 1 point to its value. Whenever a region is scored, the nature or industry counter is placed on a windmill track. When the windmill track is filled, a windmill scoring round takes place. To score at the windmill, players need to place Rangers on a special Ranger track (instead of placing them in a base, as they normally would do). The player with the most Rangers on the Ranger track receives the value of the windmill in victory points. The second place receives half, the third place receives half of the second place. After the windmill scoring round, the counters on the windmill are removed and the players have to take half of their Rangers on the Ranger track back. Several windmill scoring rounds are possible. At the end of the game, an extra windmill scoring round takes place.&#10;&#10;"
Authentic Demolition Derby,Card Game,2,4,"This is a simulation of a real demolition derby as it is done at your local fair grounds.&#10;&#10;The box contents are:&#10;A toy car for each player.&#10;Damage tracking sheets.&#10;Combat cards.&#10;Derby action cards.&#10;&#10;The car damage areas are divided into Engine, Tires, and Frame. Each area starts with 7 points. Cards are played indicating how the cars hit i.e. front-to-front rear-to-driver-side-tire, front-to-Passenger-side-door, etc. When the Tires or Engine are reduced to zero points your car is disabled and you are out of the game. When the Frame is reduced to zero any further hit there will do a point of damage to the Tires and the Engine.&#10;&#10;The toy cars track relative car positions on the playing field since these have an effect on what area of a particular car is available to be hit.&#10;&#10;"
Babel,Ancient,2,2,"In Babel, each player makes use of members of various tribes of the ancient world to build temples, exploit (or exterminated) their opponent's work force, destroy or steal their opponent's temples and otherwise do whatever it takes to build the tallest temples to win the game.&#10;&#10;The game plays out on a small game board representing regions of 5 ancient civilizations, Medes, Sumerians, Hitites, Persians, and Assyrians.  Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.&#10;&#10;Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.  If the opponent [i]does have[/i] more than 10 points, the game continues until one player reaches 20 points (in which case he or she wins) OR one player subsequently drops below 10 (in which case he or she loses).&#10;&#10;"
Balanx,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"Balanx is a 2 player balancing game by Kris Burm. The game has a low plastic see-saw grid with spaced grooves. Players have 10 heavy glass marbles in black and white, the same as found in Abalone, and 2 small steel ball bearings.&#10;Players start with their marbles on the opposite side and corner of the grid and move them towards themselves forwards and sideways, but not diagonally. The trick is that before a player moves, they hold the balancing board down on their side, making the marbles roll along the grooves and changing the set up entirely. In addition, the steel balls run in side grooves, affecting the balance of the board and making the game very challenging.&#10;The winner is the first to get their balls across to their corner, but if any balls are left in the opponents corner to block a finish, you lose. &#10;Rules in English, French, Dutch and Swedish.&#10;&#10;Was awarded the title &quot;Best Abstract Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1997.&#10;&#10;"
Balloon Cup,Aviation / Flight,2,2,"In Balloon Cup, the players compete in several short balloon flights (hops) to collect the colored cubes associated with each hop. Four landscape cards &ndash; two plains alternating with two mountains &ndash; are laid out, and 1, 2, 3, or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added to these cards. From a hand of eight balloon cards, you must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent's side &ndash; a move that can really ruin the opponent's plans.&#10;&#10;High-valued balloons are played on the mountains, and low-valued balloons are played on the plains. Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over &ndash; mountains becomes plains and vice-versa &ndash; and refilled with cubes. Five trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards. When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color. Players may even trade three otherwise useless cubes for one they can use. The first player to earn three trophy cards is the winner!&#10;&#10;"
Bambuti,Card Game,2,2,"The Bambuti tribe has an annual competition where the villagers bring their most valuable family belongings--large, richly engraved wooden masks--which are constantly pushed back and forward among the participants until the sound of the jungle drums abruptly stops.

Barbarossa,Deduction,3,6,"Barbarossa, in Italian &quot;red beard&quot; was, according to its inventor, inspired by the fantasy trilogy Die Schule der R&auml;tselmeister (School of the Riddle Masters), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments. In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.&#10;&#10;You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.&#10;&#10;Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.&#10;&#10;A later-developed game with similarities to Barbarossa is Cluzzle.&#10;&#10;Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.&#10;&#10;Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.&#10;&#10;"
Basari,Negotiation,3,4,"Several games use the simultaneous action selection mechanism, but this is perhaps one of the best.&#10;&#10;Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace, racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). &#10;Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase:&#10;&#10;For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track.&#10;&#10;They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Edel, Stein & Reich&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Batik,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"From Kris Burm, the designer of the GIPF series, A combination of Tetris and Bausack in which each player has a set of wooden pieces in various shapes. The playing area is formed from two sheets of parallel Plexiglas. Players take turns dropping pieces into the gap until a piece cannot be wholly inserted. The owner of that piece loses the round, and forfeits the offending piece. A new round begins, with the winner of the previous round playing first. Play continues until one player has no pieces when it is their turn to move; they lose the game.&#10;&#10;Batik Kid is essentially the same game, but instead of geometric shapes, the playing pieces are irregularly-shaped and represent sea creatures.&#10;&#10;"
Battle Cry,American Civil War,2,2,"A low complexity game of a variety of civil war battles.  Modular terrain through the use of hexagonal tiles allows for the setup of several famous civil war battle fields and a plethora of plastic civil war miniatures are used to represent the various forces during the conflict (infantry, cavalry, artillery and leaders).  Players manage a hand of cards that provide different orders to your troops in the right flank, left flank and center position of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;This game is the first to use what would evolve into Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.&#10;&#10;The game rules include the following scenarios:&#10;First Bull Run--21st July, 1861&#10;Pea Ridge--7th March, 1862&#10;Kernstown--23rd March, 1862&#10;Shiloh--6th April, 1862&#10;Gaines Mill--27th June, 1862&#10;Brawner's Farm--28th August, 1862&#10;Antietam--17th September, 1862&#10;Fredericksburg--13th December, 1862&#10;Murfreesboro--31st December, 1862&#10;Chancellorsville--3rd May, 1863&#10;Gettysburg--2nd July, 1863&#10;Gettysburg--3rd July, 1863&#10;Chickamauga--20th September, 1863&#10;New Market--15th May, 1864&#10;New Hope Church--25th May, 1864&#10;&#10;"
Battle Line,Ancient,2,2,"Two opponents face off across a 'battle line' and attempt to win the battle by taking 5 of 9 flags or 3 adjacent flags. Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc). The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag.&#10;&#10;This is a rethemed version of Schotten-Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards.  Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an &quot;advanced variant&quot;. Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten.&#10;&#10;Some have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten-Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.  In the second edition of GMT's Battle Line the card quality is higher.&#10;&#10;"
Battleball,Miniatures,2,2,Global football has moved beyond the restrictive rules of the US Football League. Physical enhancements have made the sport more intense and more deadly. Players have developed distinctive skills to overpower enemy players. Some are fast. Some are strong. All are out to eliminate their opponents.&#10;&#10;Plan your strategy to get safely into the end zone. Your opponent will do everything he can to destroy your players and take possession of the ball. Can you overpower them and score a touchdown? Score two touchdowns and you'll be the Battleball champ!&#10;&#10;
Bayon,Adventure,2,4,"Players hire explorers who must be sent on expeditions. Each explorer has different abilities, and each expedition has different requirements (the more difficult the expedition, the higher the reward in gold). Often it is necessary to use more than one explorer for an expedition.&#10;The first player to win a certain amount of gold wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
Beowulf: The Legend,Adventure,2,5,"(not to be confused with Knizia's Beowulf: The Movie Board Game)&#10;&#10;From FFG Spring 2005 Catalog:&#10;&#10;The fascinating legend of the great hero Beowulf is told in one of the oldest works of English literature.  This game relives the legend of how the Geatish warrior Beowulf comes to the aid of the Danish King against the fearsome monster Grendel, how he returns to his home in Geatland to become King, and how Beowulf meets his end when fighting the terrible dragon.&#10;&#10;Beowulf the Legend, designed by renowned game designer Reiner Knizia, invites you to accompany the mighty hero as one of his brave comrades.  Will you become the most renowned warrior and succeed Beowulf as king?  Only the strongest will prevail!&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of auctions depicting different events in the legend of Beowulf. Players &quot;bid&quot; in the auctions by offering up cards representing the skills they will offer to help Beowulf succeed (fighting, cunning, etc.) in an attempt to earn rewards of points or powerful cards, or to avoid injuries or other penalties. Players can also take a `Risk' and draw two cards from the deck to bid with. But if the cards don't match the current auction, the player is forced to drop out. Players need to carefully manage their hands and the timing of when they choose to take risks to increase their chances of winning.&#10;&#10;"

Blink,Action / Dexterity,2,3,"The two-minute-long, two-player card game Blink bills itself as the fastest game in the world. Without taking turns, players race to empty their hands by matching the color, shape, or number of symbols on their cards in hand to the top card of the two discard piles in the center of the table. As soon as a player lays down one card, they can draw another, up to the hand size of three cards. If a player can't play, they can discard one card, then draw another. The first player to empty their hand and draw pile wins.&#10;&#10;The rulebook includes variants for three- and four-player games.&#10;&#10;Blink: Bible Edition is the same game with Christian faith icons.&#10;&#10;"
Blokus,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"Blokus (officially pronounced &quot;Block us&quot;) is an abstract strategy game with transparent, Tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board.  The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.&#10;&#10;There is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Blokus Game Board (400 squares)&#10;84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)&#10;Each color inlcudes:&#10;&#10;     1 one-square piece&#10;     1 piece with 2 squares&#10;     2 pieces with 3 squares&#10;     5 pieces with 4 squares&#10;     12 pieces with 5 squares&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game:&#10;&#10;Each player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible.&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;1.  Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.&#10;&#10;2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.&#10;&#10;3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.&#10;&#10;Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.&#10;&#10;No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.&#10;&#10;4.  Whenever a player is unable to place one of his/her remaining pieces on the board, that player must pass his/her turn.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;The game ends when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces.  This also includes any players who may have placed all of their pieces on the board.  Scores are tallied, and the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;Each player counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining pieces (1 unit square = -1 point).&#10;&#10;A player earns +15 points if all his/her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square).&#10;&#10;There are unauthorized versions of the game published under various names, including The Strategy Game, Tetris, Blok&aacute;d (unofficial Hungarian version with cardboard pieces) and The Family Chess Game.&#10;&#10;"
Blue Moon,Card Game,2,2,"Blue Moon is a card game for two players, which has often been compared to Magic: The Gathering, although it has considerably different game mechanics. Particularly, it is not a CCG: There are no random cards in any expansion. It can thus be regarded as the first LCG, although it doesn't use that term yet.&#10;&#10;It is set in the fictional world of Blue Moon, where different peoples fight for dominance of the world and the favor of the Dragons.&#10;Each people has its own unique traits and gameplay mechanics, and is represented by a 30 card deck.&#10;&#10;The standard game box contains the 'Vulca' and the 'Hoax' decks, a small gameboard and three small plastic dragon miniatures, used as scoring counters in the game.&#10;&#10;Other decks can be bought separately as expansions with 31 or 30 cards each.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Rules overview from the official rules:&#10;&#10;The game consists of independent consecutive fights. The starting player begins the first fight.&#10;&#10;Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight.&#10;During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas.&#10;Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total&#10;power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&rsquo;s power, and so on. &ndash; If a player is unable to do&#10;this, he must retreat from the fight.&#10;&#10;A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of&#10;dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up&#10;discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.&#10;&#10;Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with&#10;dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals).&#10;A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Description from the publisher.&#10;&#10;The world of Blue Moon is in chaos. Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all! In this original 2-player game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance. The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures. Expansion packs contain additional people cards.&#10;&#10;Blue Moon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;"
Breaking Away,Abstract Strategy,2,9,"A luck free race game based on cycling. Players control a team of 4 cyclists. For each cyclist the player chooses one of his available movement allowances and moves that many squares. Once all cyclists have moved the expended movement allowances are replaced with new ones calculated according to the cyclist's position in the peloton; being at the back of a group brings a high replacement value, being at the front a low one.&#10;&#10;Sprint points are earned by being among the first 8 to cross the sprint lines so there is always a trade-off between slipstreaming (&quot;drafting&quot;) the other riders in order to build up high movement allowances and making a break for the front to be the first to cross the finish line.&#10;&#10;Note: the standard game comes with 6 teams but additional teams can be ordered to make it an up to 12 player game. The additional colours are orange, pink, purple, brown, silver, and gold.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net (real-time, AI option)&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Bucket Brigade,Animals,3,5,"Card game with a racing track by Reiner Knizia. Players use colored cards (numbered 1 or 2) to move four colored tokens along a track. The color that wins the race makes cards in that color worth +3 at the end of the round.  The other three, depending on how far they advanced, are worth anywhere from +2 to -1.  If a color moved farther, its color are worth more points -- but you probably spent more of that color to move it there, giving you fewer points!  Irony.&#10;&#10;The new Bucket Brigade edition by Face 2 Face Games uses the exact same rules, score levels on the racetrack, and card distribution as the original, but instead of Honeybears, the racing tokens are firemen ascending a ladder.&#10;&#10;"
Burger Joint,Economic,2,2,"In this two-player game, each player runs a chain of fast-food joints: one specializes in burgers and the other in pizzas. As each expands, he takes on some of the menu items of the other in order to compete for customers. Later, each can open family restaurants and even high-class dining establishments. The most successful chain will win in the end!&#10;&#10;Players alternate  turns as the active player. Each turn consists of five actions.&#10;1.    Production. Where a player draws cubes from a bag (Here the cubes represent different resources.)&#10;2.    Players trade and use special abilities to convert cubes into more helpful combinations.&#10;3.    Spend their resources to build up their fast food empire (by improving their restaurants to diners or by increasing their publicity)&#10;4.    Calculating their current score &ndash; first player to 12 victory points wins.&#10;5.    Discard unused and excess goods in preparation to start the next round.&#10;&#10;"
Café International,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"This game revolves around the placement of multi-national customers in a restaurant. The board shows many different tables, each with four chairs around them. The tables are grouped by nation, so the Chinese like to sit with other Chinese. However, some of the chairs are on the border between two nations, so a person from either place could occupy the seat. To further complicate this odd tile game, each of the people is either male or female, and tables must be gender-balanced.  As the game progresses some tiles become unplayable...&#10;&#10;"
Café International: Das Kartenspiel,Card Game,2,5,The card game version of the 1989 Spiel des Jahres boardgame &quot;Caf&eacute; International&quot;.&#10;&#10;Five table cards are laid out to form the &quot;Caf&eacute;&quot;. Players then place 1 to 3 guest cards from their hand to the Caf&eacute; scoring points for placement.  Bonuses are given if only 1 nationality is seated at a given table.  Once a table is full all the guests and the table itself are removed from play and a new table is put in it's place from the table draw pile.  Multiple scoring opportunities occur when a guest card is placed between tables with several guests at each.&#10;&#10;
Camden,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"Camden is a game about drawing and laying cards (acting as tiles) to form a highly abstracted street market. What sets the game apart from other games in the tile-laying genre is that the cards can be placed almost anywhere on the board and in almost any orientation.  Cards may touch at corners, and the corner of one card may touch the side of another.&#10;&#10;Players advance by purchasing stores formed by the cards and collecting revenue from those stores at the beginning of each subsequent turn. Symbols on cards may trigger effects when drawn, either destroying or emptying the largest store, or giving players bonus payouts.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the first player to reach 50 points.&#10;&#10;Since revenue comes from the quality of your store, but other players can play tiles to alter that store, the overall result is a cutthroat mind-bender, making it one of the most popular games of Cheapass's Hip Pocket Games series. The game was originally released as Agora in 2002, with the theme of an ancient Greek marketplace.&#10;&#10;"
Can't Stop,Dice,2,4,"In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;"
Candamir: The First Settlers,Exploration,2,4,"Here's a description of the game from AllGames4you:&#10;&#10;With the new Catan-game &quot;The First Settlement&quot;, Klaus Teuber distances himself the most from the well-known game mechanics of the Settlers series.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of newcomers to Catan and learn how the adventurous life in the first settlement played itself out. They explore, using a new movement mechanic, for the raw materials they need to build the settlement. Along the way, they discover useful natural products - but also encounter wild animals and are confronted with adventurous situations. Those who survive these encounters obtain the raw materials they sought as well as experience points that improve the abilities of the player's character. Over time, then, the player becomes stronger, smarter or more charismatic and is better and better suited for the dangers of the wild.&#10;&#10;Back in the village, the natural products can be used to brew beverages while the raw materials are used for building. Through this building, the settlement grows and players obtain victory points.&#10;&#10;The main attraction of the game lies in the exploration of the island and the development of the individual player characters. But trading and interaction between the players is also important.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;"
Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers,Prehistoric,2,5,"Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers is a standalone game in the Carcassonne series set in the stone age.&#10;&#10;As in other Carcassonne games, players take turns placing tiles to create the landscape and placing meeples to score points from the map they're creating. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Instead of cities, roads, and farms, Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers has forests, rivers, lakes, and meadows. Players' meeples can represent hunters (when placed in the meadows), gatherers (in a forest), or fishermen (on a river segment). They also have huts, which can be placed on rivers or lakes to get fish from the entire river system.&#10;&#10;It includes many of the familiar mechanics from Carcassonne with a few new rules, including:&#10;- A player who completes a forest with a gold nugget in it gets to immediately draw and place a tile.&#10;- A meadow is worth 2 points for every animal in it, except tigers, which negate certain other animals.&#10;- A river segment is worth the number of tiles in the segment plus the number of fish in the lakes at each end.&#10;- A fishing hut scores at the end of the game and is worth the number of fish in all the lakes connected by rivers.&#10;&#10;The Devir edition includes (the relevant part of) the Carcassonne: King & Scout expansion.&#10;&#10;"
Cartagena,Pirates,2,5,"Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena. Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&#10;&#10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&#10;&#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!&#10;&#10;"
Catan,Civilization,3,4,"In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by Kosmos and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&#10;&#10;The Settlers of Catan is the original game in the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;"
Chess,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typicially featuring games and commentary by chess masters.&#10;&#10;The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.&#10;&#10;"
Chicken Cha Cha Cha,Animals,2,4,"Theme: Chickens are learning to dance (&quot;cha cha&quot;) by completing circuits around the yard.&#10;&#10;Goal: To &quot;cha cha&quot; your chicken past every single other player's chicken, stealing each one's &quot;tail feathers&quot; as you go by them. The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.&#10;&#10;Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.&#10;&#10;This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch&#10;&#10;The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.&#10;The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.&#10;&#10;"
China,Ancient,3,5,"China is an abstracted game of political influence in China. Players use cards to place pieces (Houses or Emissaries) into the nine regions on the board. When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for majorities of houses in that region. At game end, players then score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board.&#10;&#10;This fascinating game of domination combines multiple tactical possibilities with simple-to-learn rules and a short playing time!&#10;&#10;Even today in China, the unmistakable evidence of a fascinating story is everywhere. Hundreds of years ago, the country teetered on the brink of a change in power. Regional rulers fought continuously with each other with only one goal in mind: to become the new Emperor. They erected imposing houses and sent their emissaries to the regional courts.&#10;&#10;China is based on the award-winning game Web of Power by master game designer Michael Schacht. China differs from Web of Power in that there is no &quot;half-time&quot; scoring of regions as there is in the earlier game; there are four face-up cards to draw from instead of just two; and all adjacent regions have Emissary scoring opportunities, whereas in Web of Power, some adjacent regions did not. &#10;A special variant with fortifications is included.&#10;&#10;Aside from these differences, the two games are essentially the same.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.boardgames-online.net (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;implemented bonus maps: Web of Power, Hellenia, Skandinavia, America, AD 850, Life on Mars, Big in Japan&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Web of Power&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    China - Das Duell (Two-player variant)&#10;    China Erweiterung&#10;    China: Grenzstreitigkeiten&#10;    China Einflusskarten&#10;    China: The Embassies&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Chinatown,City Building,3,5,"This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word. In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections.  At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better.  All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations.&#10;&#10;This game is #2 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;"
"Ciao, Ciao...",Bluffing,2,4,"According to the rules, &quot;the coolest player wins&quot;. This is a bluffing game in which players try to move their pawns safely across a bridge. The bridge spans a swamp full of hungry, carnivorous plants (the inside of the game box). This tiny boardgame is contained within the box-the box is entirely covered, inside and out, with the riotous, hungry swamp. A secret dice mechanism provides opportunity for skillful bluffing. A sharp little game.&#10;&#10;Ages 10 and up.&#10;&#10;"
Cloud 9,Aviation / Flight,3,6,"Cloud 9 - The Daring Game of Ups and Downs&#10;&#10;Players earn points by daring to stay in the basket of a hot air balloon as it rises. Points increase as the balloon climbs from cloud to cloud, but so does the risk of the balloon falling. Should you jump out to save your points or trust that the pilot will take you safely higher?&#10;&#10;Everyone places their passenger token into the balloon's basket to start the trip, and receives a hand of six balloon cards. Then, each turn, a different &quot;pilot&quot; rolls an increasing number of specialized dice to see if the balloon can stay aloft. The dice dictate how many of the balloon cards are needed of each color. (There are also optionally played Wild Cards to keep everyone guessing.) Each player decides whether they think the pilot will have the cards to successfully take the balloon up, or whether they should jump out and keep the points earned so far. If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud. Everyone hops aboard and draws one new card, and the next trip begins. When a player earns 50 points the game is over.&#10;&#10;"
Clue,Bluffing,3,6,"The classic detective game!  In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file.  A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.&#10;&#10;"
Coloretto,Animals,2,5,"Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection. A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.&#10;&#10;Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is &plusmn;1 point, the second card is &plusmn;2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!&#10;&#10;A two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.&#10;&#10;"
Colossal Arena,Card Game,2,5,"Colossal Arena/Titan: This is a strategic card game for 2 to 5 players: you play, not as combatants, but as spectators, cheering and betting on the melee ongoing in a fantasy arena/colosseum in which fantasy creatures are pitted against each other in battle!&#10;&#10;Each round one of the creatures will die. To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.  The jockeying for position and strategic diplomacy in playing the numbered power cards can be intense - but what makes this game even more interesting is that the players' place bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power in battle!&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the bettor who's raked in the most winnings - just another day in the life of a fantasy monster gambler.&#10;&#10;Titan: The Arena is actually a reworking of a Reiner Knizia game called Grand National Derby, but Avalon Hill's remake was quite significant from a gameplay standpoint.&#10;&#10;The Titan: The Arena printing is often confused with its namesake, Titan.  But other than the fact that they both use fantasy creatures as a general theme, there is very little that is similar between the two.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: Galaxy: The Dark Ages&#10;&#10;"
Compatibility,Card Game,4,6,"Play is in teams of two. Each person has a deck of picture cards. Each deck has the same set of pictures. There is also a deck of word cards with words like &quot;marriage&quot;, &quot;de facto&quot;, and &quot;pimple&quot;.&#10;&#10;A word is chosen and each player chooses 2-5 cards from his/her deck. Teams score points for choosing the same pictures, and score extra points for putting the pictures in the same order (from most to least important).&#10;&#10;The board is used to keep track of the score, and to dictate how many pictures a team may select.

Schaper in 1949. However, Schaper's game was not the first based upon the insect known as the &quot;cootie&quot;. The creature was the subject of several tabletop games, mostly pencil and paper games, in the decades of the twentieth century following World War I.&#10;&#10;In 1927, the J. H. Warder Company of Chicago released Tu-Tee, and the Charles Bowlby Company released Cootie; though based on a &quot;build a bug&quot; concept similar to Schaper's, both were paper and pencil games.&#10;Schaper's game was the first to employ a fully three dimensional, free-standing plastic cootie.&#10;&#10;Known in Australia as Creepy Critters and in the UK as Beetle Drive.&#10;&#10;"

Das Amulett,Fantasy,3,6,"The objective of Das Amulett is to collect jewels to complete your amulet. You need seven different colored jewels or eight of any kind of jewels to complete the amulet and win the game. Powerful spell cards are auctioned off each turn using a fixed set of energy stones. (Each player has ten to use throughout the game.) The winning bidder places their winning bid (in energy stones) on the acquired spell card; this card will remain in play for a length of time related to the number of energy stones placed on it. Each turn energy stones are removed from the spell cards, and these energy stones are then available again for future bidding (so these energy stones are recycled throughout the game). The spell cards give each player some resource production (four different kinds of metals) and usually a special ability that can be used in the game. With the metal resources, the jewels are auctioned off on the main board and are acquired by the players in their quest to complete their amulet.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by&#10;&#10;&#10;    Wizard's Brew&#10;&#10;&#10;"

First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players.

Each partnership takes the part of either the Sun or Moon cult, and plays cards only of its designated suit. An interesting mechanic is that since the cards are dealt randomly, it is often necessary and even prudent to have an opponent play a card for you. The object of the game is to collect souls (of either cult) and temples of your own suit (which serve as a multiplier). Rounds move quickly, and points can add up dramatically.

But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.&#10;&#10;As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sixty-second sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all of the dragons have been slain and the treasure claimed or discarded, the game ends and players score for their holdings, with silver and magic objects worth 1 point each, gold worth 3, the Black Diamond worth 7, and the colored gems scoring 10-15 points for those players who hold more than everyone else. (In the Advanced game, the colored gems score 8-12 points in addition to a variety bonus of 5 points for each set of different colored gems a player holds. The Black Diamond is worth 19 points [in the 2011 edition], but negates a player's score for all colored gems.)&#10;&#10;"

Egizia,Ancient,2,4,"The players are builders in Ancient Egypt, competing to get the most fame building different monuments requested by the Pharaoh (the Sphinx, the Obelisk, the Temple, and the Pyramid).&#10;&#10;The game lasts 5 turns. In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.&#10;&#10;In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that &quot;pawns&quot; are placed, since &quot;workers&quot; are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).&#10;&#10;When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).&#10;&#10;After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards. Whoever has the highest total is the winner.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Eight-Minute Empire,Print & Play,2,5,"Eight-Minute Empire, by Ryan Laukat, is a quick game that implements the Civilization/Exploration theme using card-driven area control (by placing armies and cities in a small map) and set collection (by getting resources from the board and the cards). Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.&#10;&#10;Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013. An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends).&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;Build an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes!&#10;&#10;In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed.  The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately.  Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects.&#10;&#10;Eight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions.  It's easy to learn and perfect for when you only have a few minutes.&#10;&#10;"
El Grande,Renaissance,2,5,"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;"
Elefantenparade,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"Players have 2 elephants each which move along the track, collecting mahogany logs if possible. You can either move any 3 elephants 1,2 &amp; 3 spaces in any order, or you can move all the elephants in a parade forward one place. The logs are on certain squares, so you try to move the other elephants so that yours land exactly onto the logs, without getting detached from the parade. Other squares are water, which lock the elephant down until all have passed, unless you have a parade and everyone moves forward one. At the end of the track are three palaces with more logs for the first, second and third elephants home. Most logs wins. A lovely game with Indian graphics and neat wooden elephants.&#10;&#10;"
Elfenland,Fantasy,2,6,"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

Or buy action cards that give random but powerful benefits. You can also trade resources with your fellow players.&#10;&#10;Or you might want to hold onto them, because once you have three of a particular resource in your hand, you can lay them down in front of you. Once you've laid a resource down, you can add additional cards to the set as you get them. When the set contains seven cards, you've cornered that resource. Corner enough resources and you win the game!&#10;&#10;You win a game of Empyrean, Inc. by being the first player to corner the market in 2, 3 or 4 different resources, depending on the number of players in the game.

Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons,Exploration,2,4,"[Careful: there are two similar games with Entdecker in the title. Don't confuse Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons) with Entdecker, a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board does not have a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]&#10;&#10;A reworking of the game Entdecker, this game still starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed, islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, forts, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful explorer.&#10;&#10;Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence. This updated version adds a larger board, fees to enter from all but one edge of the board, a different income system, new bonus waterfall tiles, the ability to draw (for a price) from open stacks of tiles, and most of all an entirely new area of the board that represents scouts exploring jungles on the islands in search of exotic plants (this is the bonus discovery chip system revamped), and other changes.&#10;&#10;"
Escape: The Curse of the Temple,Adventure,1,5,"Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.&#10;&#10;The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A cursed mask &ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.&#10;    A golden mask &ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.&#10;    A red torch or blue key &ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.&#10;    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.&#10;&#10;&#10;Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.&#10;&#10;The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&#10;&#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&#10;&#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &quot;Curses&quot; module, some tiles &quot;curse&quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!&#10;&#10;"
Esels-Rennen,Animals,2,6,"First issued in 1989 for fewer players, the second edition (released in 1996) is for 2-6 players. The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides. Possibly Doris & Frank's first game and related to their Bunny Zick-Zack.&#10;&#10;3rd Place 1989 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (as Donky [sic]).&#10;&#10;"
Excape,Dice,3,6,"This is Reiner Knizia's answer to venerable gamer designer Sid Sackson's Can't Stop.  For a turn, a player rolls two dice.  The die results are used to create a two digit number, like sixty-five or twenty-two.  If the result is a double, you can move your marker forward.  However, you can continue re-rolling your dice if the result isn't high enough.  Assuming you haven't ended your turn by rolling any of the X's on the dice, then you can 'bid' the results of your dice for movement.  If no one's beat your bid by the time it is your turn again, then you move your token that many spaces.&#10;&#10;"
Face-it,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"On a grid you place one of your 4 tiles on the board trying to make as large sets as possible.  There are four colours (faces) and a special white tile.  You get points for how large the group of like faces that border on each other are.  The points are taken from your neighbor.  The points are in the form of coins from 1 to 5 in worth forcing kids to actually do math (shudder).  The tiles is replaced after playing and if the white tile is drawn it allows the player to steal a tile from another player and the white tile is then replaced in the bag for others to possibly draw again in the future.&#10;&#10;For the younger kids it can teach color matching.  You can also play with the expressions on the tiles (Happy, sad, scared and mad), such as when you play a tile you have to make the expression.&#10;&#10;A simple game for ages 3 to 7 (although the box says 5 and up)&#10;&#10;"
Fact or Crap,Card Game,3,8,"Basic trivia game where players try to figure out if a statement is a Fact, or just a load of Crap.&#10;&#10;The players take turns being the Reader in a clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;After the Reader has read the first question, the other players have to decide as fast as they can whether the answer is Fact or Crap.  The players indicate their answer by putting face down either their Fact Answer card or Crap Answer card.  The Reader then determines which player was the first to put their Answer card down.  Once all of the Answer cards are down, the player who was first to answer turns over their Answer card.  If the answer is correct, they receive 2 tokens from the middle pile.  The Reader will then ask everyone to turn their Answer cards over.  All other players with the correct answer will receive 1 token.  All players with the wrong answer (including the player who puts their Answer card down first) will have to put 1 token back in the middle pile.&#10;The Reader&rsquo;s turn is complete when all 3 questions have been read.  The Question card is then returned, face down, to the bottom of the Question card pile.&#10;&#10;During the game you will randomly draw Rush Hour cards.  The Reader who picks up a Rush Hour card may nominate any player to answer the Rush Hour questions.  Once the nomination has been made, the egg timer is turned over and the Reader begins to read the questions.  The aim is to have all 5 questions asked and answered within the time limit so that both Reader and the answering player have a chance to win as many extra tokens as possible.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win Fact or Crap.&#10;- The game ends when all tokens from the middle pile are gone.  Players then count up their tokens.  The player with the most tokens is the winner, proving they know the most Fact or Crap!&#10;- In the event that all players but 1 have lost their tokens, the remaining player is deemed the winner.&#10;If at any time during the game a player loses all of their tokens, s/he is then out of the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    SpongeBob SquarePants Fact or Fishy DVD Game&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Falling,Card Game,4,8,"This game is from an odd genre, real-time card games.  Each of the players (except the dealer) is a person falling to his death.

Familienbande,Card Game,2,4,"Here is a description of the game from Spielbox:&#10;&#10;Familienbande is the third game in Winning Moves&rsquo; new &ldquo;Compact Game&rdquo; series, and is by Leo Colovini. It&rsquo;s a fast and funny board game that deals with the dynastic succession of royal families. Brides are chosen, heirs are born. Unmistakable traits such as large noses, red hair or cauliflower ears are depicted on the humorously-illustrated cards; these traits must be used to score points and be combined in engagements and births.

Favoriten,Racing,2,5,"Favoriten is a simple betting/race game with a nifty element of press-your-luck thrown in.&#10;&#10;Five horses are involved in each of three races.  Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.&#10;&#10;That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. &quot;I'll back the green horse&quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.&#10;&#10;Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).&#10;&#10;The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.  If you back an unpopular horse, you'll watch it lag behind.  If you wait until everyone else is pushing a particular horse, you gain very little for joining the bandwagon late in the game.&#10;&#10;"
Fearsome Floors,Horror,2,7,"The storyline in Friedemann Friese's Fearsome Floors (aka, Finstere Flure) continues the FFF-saga from Friese's earlier game, with players trying to escape from F&uuml;rst Fieso. Story aside, what we have is a wonderful race game in which the players must move through a dungeon as quickly as possible &ndash; or at least within 14 turns &ndash; before it crumbles over their heads.&#10;&#10;Players could reach the exit in only seven turns if everything were peaceful and quiet, but unfortunately the dungeon is also the home of a very hungry monster! Each round, players take turns moving one disk at a time, flipping over the disk after moving it to reveal the movement points available for the next round. They can try to lead the monster, who is always after fresh prey, to opponents' pieces, but they may find themselves eaten instead! Pieces can slide along blood slicks or might be crushed between a boulder and a wall. You can even try to get the monster to teleport to another part of the board, where it will fall upon its next victim!&#10;&#10;"
Fettnapf,Card Game,2,5,"In Fettnapf by Reinhard Staupe, the object of the game is to avoid collecting Fettnapf cards. Sounds simple, but as the game title suggests, little problems arise everywhere. In turn order, cards are played out and the values added together or subtracted: 24&hellip;29&hellip;32&hellip;25&hellip; but beware: if you say a number that someone has in hand, then you&rsquo;ve put your foot in it. Those with a talent for this will learn how to ship a Fettnapf around and win the game.&#10;&#10;Each player receives 3 cards (valued 0 to 9) and an island card (10 to 30). In turn order, each player plays a card and draws a new one into his hand. The played-out cards get added (up to 30) or subtracted (down to 10) and announced out loud: 24-28-32-26-18-9-12. Whenever a player goes over the limit, the right-hand player gets an island card. When a player announces a number that another player has in hand as an island card, then he&rsquo;s put his foot in it and receives a Fettnapf card. The game ends when a player has collected 4 Fettnapf cards. The winner is the player with the fewest Fettnapf cards.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Cowabunga&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Feurio!,Abstract Strategy,1,4,The game mechanism simulates a spreading forest fire which the players try to bring under control. They place firefighters in different parts of the forest and try to achieve two objectives:&#10;&#10;     to fight the most dangerous fires to earn points (adding up high numbers) and &#10;     to occupy at least one water source (player's points are divided by the lowest number they occupy).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The fire limits the spaces where people can be placed and eliminates water sources. The direction of the fire's spread is determined by the current situation and can be guessed quite accurately by watching the game closely. It is a highly territorial game with lots of blocking and chasing.&#10;&#10;The game also includes a solitaire and a cooperative variant.&#10;&#10;

Fische Fluppen Frikadellen,Economic,2,5,"What a fuss. The frightfully fearsome feudal lord Fieso has held the fascinating fairy Fabula in captivity since the famous February festivities. In order to free the fairy must you redeem her from the Fieso's fetid and fusty feculent fetter. Frustrated you flee into the Finnish fjords in order to fetch a few of the fascinating fetishes so highly favored by the foul prince. Frantically you begin bartering with the local folks: a few Florins will get you some Fish which can be traded for Flowers, which again can be traded for Fur, Fruits, Flutes, Fettucine, Furniture, Fuel, Fiddles or maybe even a fridge. When your finances allow you to obtain 3 different fetishes you have won the game.&#10;&#10;In Fische Fluppen Frikadellen, players are traders running (or sailing on a raft!) around a town, visiting various market stalls in order to buy, sell, or trade goods.  There are three different types of stalls in the game.  Merchants will sell you a specific good of the 5 base goods in the game according to current market prices, and will also buy a specific good from you, also according to market prices.  Traders will accept a specific good and give you two of a specific good in return.  Finally, there are dealer stalls which offer fetishes.  They each want specific combinations of goods, offering you a fetish in return.  There are three different fetishes in the game, and the first player to trade for all three fetishes wins!&#10;&#10;Furthermore, whenever a player visits a market stall, a special ability of that stall activates.  These special abilities cause all sorts of game events, such as production of goods at merchants (you can't buy a good at a merchant if he doesn't have any available), price increases of goods, getting an extra turn or free commodity, changing the position of two merchants, etc.  Often times, players will need to utilize these special abilities to conquer their goals.&#10;&#10;The really unique feature of Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is that there are three different versions of the game, so it can be played by up to 15 people on three different, interconnected tables!  You'll need one copy of the game for every 5 players.&#10;&#10;At the start of a 15-player game, for example, there will be three boards, with 5 players at each board.  Each board is set up individually by the players starting there, and there are 36 merchants in the game with only 12 of them used per board, so it is very possible for each board to be significantly different than the others!  Furthermore, there will only be one of the three fetishes available at each board, so players will need to sail off to all three boards over the course of the game in order to win!  This means picking up all of your things and moving to a different table.&#10;&#10;You aren't allowed to peek at the other tables before you move, which means it is a complete surprise what the market conditions and various stalls will be on the board that you move to.  This mechanic also means that there will not always be an equal amount of players at each board throughout the game, so players at boards with less players will likely get turns more frequently than players at boards with more players; another reason to leave your current board for a different one!&#10;&#10;"
Fish Eat Fish,Animals,2,5,"From  publisher's website: In a wave of challenges and bluffs, players compete for control of the sea.  Play your cards right and watch your stack of fish grow.

Stacks of 1 - 5 fish are moved around the board in search of prey.  Adjacent stacks engage in combat.  Cards are played, and the number on the card is added to the number of fish in a player's stack.  Highest total wins the combat, and that player's stack is placed on top of the loser's.  If a stack contains more than 5 fish, the extras are placed in the winner's pool of caught fish.  Ties result in both stacks of fish being discarded.  Cards may only be played once, so players must balance the need to win a combat with the need to hold on to high cards for future combats against growing stacks!&#10;&#10;"
Fist of Dragonstones,Bluffing,3,6,"Fist of Dragonstones is a closed-fist, bidding game. Players try to outwit their opponents by using gold and magic coins to buy control of an ever-changing cast of enchanted character cards. Those characters' powers collect valuable Dragonstones; lend their magical powers; help foil other players, and convert Dragonstones into victory.&#10;For each character card, players choose the number of coins they want to bid by placing them in a closed fist. All players reveal their bets at the same time with the winner of the auction then gaining control of the card's powers. Depending on the card they may: win additional coins or Dragonstones; place spells on other players; or win scoring points.&#10;&#10;The Legend : &#10;Many, many years ago, an enchanted forest lay hidden between two great mountain ranges. The forest valley was home to several kingdoms whose rival princes battled with each other to unite the entire realm under one flag. To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.&#10;Like many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to those who could bring them stones. The allure of the princes' wealth soon filled the enchanted forest with all manner of wizards, witches, dwarves, goblins, and many other enchanted creatures - all in pursuit of the magic Dragonstones.&#10;This enchanted land is now almost entirely lost to legend. Yet, at a cozy inn, in a small forgotten village, the memory of Dragonstones is kept alive by the inn's ancient proprietor. Even today, a nod from a knowing traveler may persuade him to recount some of the ancient tales. And if he takes a particular liking to you, he may bring out his own collection of magic stones, and challenge you to a simple game of luck and skill and a chance to grab your own Dragonstones!&#10;&#10;"

Flowerpower,Abstract Strategy,1,2,"A beautiful tile-laying game where players strive to build large plots of single variety flowers.  The larger the plot, the higher the score.  Players plant their own gardens but also compete in a central connecting strip.  Players also get the chance to plant weeds into the opponent's garden, spoiling their best laid plans.&#10;&#10;Flowerpower is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;"
Fluxx,Card Game,2,6,"Fluxx is a card game in which the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game. By playing cards, you change numerous aspects of the game: how to draw cards, how to play cards, and even how to win.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game. There are many editions, themed siblings, and promo cards available.&#10;&#10;"
Football Strategy,Bluffing,2,4,"Football Strategy boils the sport down to play calling skill. The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &quot;goal line stand&quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &quot;long gains&quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.&#10;&#10;Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.&#10;&#10;For variety, three types of offense (&quot;pro style&quot;, &quot;aerial game&quot; and &quot;ball control&quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.&#10;&#10;Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &quot;More Information&quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.&#10;&#10;For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.&#10;&#10;"
Foppen,Card Game,3,6,A trick-taking card game where the object is to empty your hand.  The twist is the player who plays the lowest card in a trick sits out the next round.&#10;&#10;
Frank's Zoo,Animals,3,7,"This game is played in several hands. In each hand the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards. Their scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards. There are two ways to play: you can play where all hands are played the same, or you can play the game with changing partners.&#10;&#10;This is a climbing game, similar to The Great Dalmuti, Tichu, and others.  The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals. Each is scared away only by certain other animals.  Players set out one to whatever cards of a particular variety, and someone can play onto that pile only if they have more of that animal or an equal number of some animal that can scare it away.  Players get points by playing all their cards, collecting lions, and collecting a hedgehog.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://doris-frank.de/Games4.html&#10;&#10;"
Fresco,Renaissance,2,4,"In Fresco, players are master painters working to restore a fresco in a Renaissance church.&#10;&#10;Each round begins with players deciding what time they would like to wake up for the day. The earlier you wake up, the earlier you will be in turn order, and the better options you will be guaranteed to have. Wake up early too often, however, and your apprentices will become unhappy and stop working as efficiently. They would much rather sleep in!&#10;&#10;Then, players decide their actions for the turn, deploying their apprentice work force to various tasks. You'll need to buy paint, mix paint, work on painting the fresco, raise money (which you'll need to buy the aforementioned paint!) by painting portraits, and perhaps even send your apprentices to the opera in order to increase their happiness. Points are scored mostly by painting the fresco, which requires specific combinations of paints, so you'll need to buy and mix your paints wisely, in addition to beating other players to the paints and fresco segments you would like to paint.&#10;&#10;Fresco includes several expansion modules, so you can play without expansions for a lighter family game or add in expansions to vary play and increase the decision-making and difficulty, resulting in a very flexible game with a high replay value.&#10;&#10;"
Funny Friends,Card Game,2,6,"Each player plays a character who starts the game as a teenager and then must choose the cards that will make his life take shape. He can repeat a school year and get new friends, start smoking, take part in a Bible discussion group and have his first sexual intercourse during Oktoberfest &ndash; all very realistic. Every event in the life of a character has some effect on his main characteristics - tobacco addiction, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, wealth, health, sadness, spirituality and wisdom. Excess comes at a price, though, and when a characteristic gets too high, it cancels another one &ndash; if you smoke too much, you get thin; if you get too fat, you must stop drinking; if you drink too much you lose your wisdom, and so on &ndash; once more, very realistic. During game, you can get friends, and often more, with other player&rsquo;s characters. This is an important feature in the game, since what happens to you usually affects, in good or bad, your friends, and this is one of the main interaction aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;Description from Bruno Faidutti's ideal game library.&#10;&#10;"
Galaxy Trucker,Humor,2,4,"In a galaxy far, far away... they need sewer systems, too. Corporation Incorporated builds them. Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&#10;&#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.&#10;&#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&#10;&#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&#10;&#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&#10;&#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components. After the 3rd round the player with the most credits wins!&#10;&#10;"
Galloping Pigs,Animals,2,5,"Galloping Pigs is a cute little 'not-quite-a-children's-game' game where players are collecting points in the form of food.  Plastic pigs are placed on a track made from cards laid in a circle, and then players are given cards in the colors of the pigs.  Each turn, a player selects a card, and moves the corresponding pig one space forward.  If the space in front is occupied by another pig, then the moving pig 'leapfrogs' that, and this can continue until the pig takes the lead, which gives the active player a food card.  Play goes on like this until all cards for the round have been played, however in order to keep the food (points) you collect during a round, your final movement for the round must score some more food.&#10;&#10;Ages 6 and up&#10;&#10;"
Genoa,Negotiation,2,5,"In Genoa (originally published as The Traders of Genoa), players take the part of Renaissance traders, moving about the city acquiring goods and filling orders for goods. Messages need to be delivered and privileges obtained. Of course, none of this can be accomplished on one's own. Much negotiation and deal-making is the order of the day in an effort to become the richest deal-maker in Genoa.  Flexible rules allow for negotiating almost everything in the game.&#10;&#10;The Traders of Genoa version of this game is #6 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;"
Gerüchteküche,Card Game,3,7,"In &quot;Gossip Kitchen,&quot; players attempt to sort through the truth of the many rumors flying around. The deck consists of 10 types of rumors (each with its own symbol, such as a heart) with six cards each, for a total of 60 cards. To begin, one card is removed from play and all the remaining cards dealt out (distribution may be uneven). Players now seek to collect full sets of six rumor cards and deduce which rumor set is missing a card. Players ask another about their hand, e.g. &quot;Do you have three hearts?&quot; Players need only respond with an answer of &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; if the&#10;number asked is incorrect, and play passes clockwise from the asking player. If the number asked is correct, the questioner receives those cards and play passes to the&#10;answering player. Sets of six rumors collected are placed on the table and score three points. At any point, a player may guess which rumor group is missing, scoring 10 points &#10;for a correct guess and taking a penalty of 5 points for an incorrect guess.&#10;&#10;"
Giants,Ancient,3,5,"In this game, players incarnate clan leaders during the Golden Age of Easter Island. The board represents a simplified map of the island. Rock platforms (ahus) are where the Moa&iuml;s (monumental sculptures) will be erected.&#10;&#10;Your clan competes against others, and you will earn more prestige by building and transporting larger, more imposing Moa&iuml;s than your opponents' clans.&#10;&#10;Each of your pawns represents a group of men. You can grow your population if you wish. You will choose each turn which part of your population will sculpt Moa&iuml;s and which other part will transport them, in cooperation with other players.&#10;&#10;Statues are transported from the quarry to the ahus (the rock platforms) using paths made of pawns and the help of logs.&#10;&#10;You can use your influence (Tribal Markers) to choose the best statues and mark to your color the statues you cannot achieve in your turn. You can also rely on your Sorcerer and his mighty powers, of the strength of your Chief, as well as on mystic powers of the Rongo writing tablets.&#10;&#10;The winner will be the one who has erected the largest statues in the best places at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Note that there is a Official Rule Change for this game : For the final scoring, complete Rongo tablets are no longer scored and do not earn any points to the players.&#10;&#10;"

Except for the brain part - there is, in fact, one brain - that's the premise of Give Me the Brain!, a card game in which players take on the roles of zombies in a fast-food restaurant in hell.  They all have to complete a number of tasks before leaving work, and the work keeps piling on.  Even worse, some of the tasks require basic intelligence and there's only one brain to go around.&#10;&#10;"

In these three weeks, the breweries and beer gardens in the village make more money than during the rest of the year. So, you and your opponents become hardened businessmen, who rush to Seehausen am See to invest in the businesses there with an eye toward the large profits that come during the festival. During these three weeks each will invest in the businesses and try to get his people in management positions in the breweries and beer gardens where he owns stock. The players also work to increase the size of their favorite beer gardens so that they can earn more money. In the end, it is not the size of the beer gardens or who is in charge, but the amount of money in the players&rsquo; pockets...&#10;&#10;"
Goldland,Exploration,2,5,"Each player has a backpack with room for 12 tools, provisions, trading goods, or treasures.  The number of squares you can move on a turn is the number of empty spaces in your backpack, so the lighter you travel, the faster.&#10;&#10;In the beginning, only 13 tiles (two legs of a 7x7 square) are on the table, and everybody starts in the corner with three fish (provisions) and two pearl necklaces (trading goods).  One thing to do on your turn is &quot;explore,&quot; adding a randomly drawn tile next to the one where your pawn currently stands.  The board gradually fills in to the point where the tile at the opposite corner from the start is drawn, and this tile is designated the site of the lost temple and pays bonuses for everyone who reaches it.  The sooner you get there, the better the bonuses.&#10;&#10;About half the squares are free to enter and let you obtain other items for your backpack.  If you're already carrying a fishing pole, for example, in some squares you'll be able to pick up more fish.  The other half are &quot;adventure&quot; tiles that require the expenditure of backpack items in order to gain entry.  You might have to spend two rifles, for example, to enter a wildcat tile; then you place a &quot;camp&quot; marker and can enter that tile for free in the future.  A lot of the game involves going back and forth to tiles where you can assemble the necessary items to work your way through the adventure tiles to the lost temple.&#10;&#10;Goldland appeals to puzzle-solvers and has a fun atmosphere of exploring the wilderness in search of El Dorado.&#10;&#10;"
Great Wall of China,Card Game,2,5,"This game lets each player take on the role of a Northern Chinese prince. His task: the construction of a massive wall. His reward: Honor everlasting! To gain the honor, though, requires some sweat. The requirements are the same for each player. Each player has a set of cards in his color: seven wall cards (worth 1 point), three gate cards (worth 2 points) and one watchtower card (worth 3 points). Additionally, each player gets nine more cards of varying point value and which may also allow special actions to be carried out.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player shuffles his deck of 20 cards and places it face-down in front of himself. He then draws five cards from the deck. Now, depending on the number of players, 2 to 4 pairs of prestige tiles (with values from 1 to 8) are set out as the starts of card rows.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he first checks to see if he has a point majority in any of the card rows. Then, he carries out two additional actions. He has the choice of either drawing another card from the deck or adding cards to one of the rows. The added cards must  be identical. It is then the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;If, when checking point totals, a player sees that he does have one or more majorities, then he chooses one of the prestige tiles and puts it onto one of his cards in that row. That prestige comes at a price: as long as the second prestige tile isn't claimed, the value of the prestige is subtracted from that player's total for that row. Once the second tile is claimed (which can be by the same player on a later turn), then both winning players set the tiles they won aside to score. Two new prestige tiles are revealed and the prestige for that row replenished.&#10;&#10;The fight for prestige is also influenced by cards with special actions. For example, if a 'noble' card (1) is played, then the values of all cards in that row are reduced to 1. A 'dragon' card (1) can be played onto another player's card, neutralizing it. 'Cavalry' (2) are worth 2 points, and, equally valuably, do not cost an action. 'Infantry' (5) are strong in groups. A single 'infantry' card is only worth 1 point, but the next one is worth 2, and then 3, etc.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when one player has played his last card or when the last prestige tile is taken. Afterwards, each player gets one last turn and then all card rows are resolved in turn order. The player with the most prestige at the end of the game wins.  Players only receive prestige for tiles they have set aside for scoring.  Tiles remaining on wall segments do not score.&#10;&#10;"
Guillotine,Card Game,2,5,"The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game.  As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles.  Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.  However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting,' which is what makes the game interesting.  After three days worth of chopping, the highest total carries the day.&#10;&#10;"
Gulo Gulo,Action / Dexterity,2,6,"Each player is a Gulo, or wolverine, trying to rescue a baby Gulo who got caught by the swamp vulture whose eggs it was trying to steal.  Unfortunately for the baby Gulo, all the adult Gulos are distracted by all the delicious swamp vulture eggs, and it has to wait very, very patiently as the adults constantly trip the very, very sensitive &quot;egg alarm&quot; rigged by the vulture to scare off the pesky Gulos.&#10;&#10;There is a nice wooden bowl filled with multicolored swamp vulture eggs of various sizes, into which a long thin dowel with another egg at one end is inserted, like a flagpole.  As you can imagine, lots of M&amp;M Peanut-shaped wooden bits banging around together in a polished wooden bowl makes it rather difficult to keep a thin dowel with weight at the top balanced...&#10;&#10;The essential mechanic of the game is to try to pull an egg of a particular color and move to a tile of that color on the linear path toward the bowl, and the little stack of tiles hiding the baby Gulo tile.  If you set off the alarm, or knock any eggs out of the bowl, your Gulo is sent back to the previous tile of the attempted color.  If there's no such tile, then back to the start he goes!&#10;&#10;"
Hansa,Economic,2,4,"Players are merchants of the Hanseatic League. Players take control of the ship and buy and sell goods, establish trading posts, and sail to find new markets. The board is a very simple map of Scandinavia, with arrows from point to point restricting where the boat is able to move. The active player takes control of the boat and must pay to move to each new city where he may either buy, sell, or expand. Players want sets of goods that they can trade for victory points, but also need to expand their market presence to generate revenue.&#10;&#10;"
Hare & Tortoise,Animals,2,6,"As the first winner of the Spiel des Jahres award in 1979, Hare and Tortoise or the German Hase und Igel (for Hare and Hedgehog) will always be regarded as a classic game.  It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.  You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.  The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track.  It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.&#10;&#10;There have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare &amp; Tortoise by different publishers.  Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.&#10;&#10;&#10;      Parlett Strategic Variant--The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that &quot;... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn. This would be the equivalent of the hare taking a nap, as in Aesop's fable. This is the rule I most favour and would prefer it to simply not landing on them at all...&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Hart an der Grenze,Bluffing,3,6,"In Hart an der Grenze (Close to the Border), players are people trying to cross a border with luggage full of legal and also illegal goods.&#10;&#10;Each one declares what he is carrying, but of course he only declares what the law allows (even if it means telling a lie).&#10;&#10;Each turn one of the players takes the role of sheriff. The sheriff must choose who to spot check.&#10;In case the sheriff picks someone whose luggage does not have exactly what was declared, the person must open the luggage and show his goods. The not-declared goods are lost and a fine is paid.&#10;However, before opening the luggage, the person may always suggest that the sheriff take some of his dollars so as to be kind and let him pass. If they come to an agreement, good for them!&#10;During the whole game, players may also stock goods for the end, when the border is closed and the price is doubled. But only a limited amount of each good can be sold at this time. And the bigger traders in each kind of good will have the advantage of selling first.&#10;&#10;To sum up, Hart an der Grenze is a game with bluffing, negotiation, strategy and a lot of good laughs.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Robin Hood&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The second player has the option to play either a card with the same color, or to open a second trick by playing a card of an different color next to the allready played card. When someone plays a second color, he starts a second trick on the table. If the second player started a second trick, the third player just has the options to follow either one of the colors or discard a card of the third color (pass). He may not place a card of the third color on one of the existing tricks or start a third trick. If the second player followed the color of the first card, the third one has the option to start a 2nd trick (and so on).&#10;&#10;The players who played the card with the highest number in the respective trick win the respective cards.

Heimlich & Co.,Bluffing,2,7,"The game board in Heimlich &amp; Co. is an oval movement track, with points allocated to the various spaces. Seven differently colored &quot;spies&quot; are placed on the board. On a player's turn, he rolls a dice, then moves any combination of characters forward that number of spaces. The newly-moved spies then score points based on their new location. However, the trick here is that each player's color isn't known until the end of the game, so players are encouraged to deduce which color belongs to whom.&#10;&#10;Heimlich &amp; Co. includes advanced rules which allow players to score more points at the end of the game for correctly guessing everyone's identity.

Hera and Zeus,Bluffing,2,2,"Players are opposing gods from Greek mythology, Hera and Zeus, bent on destroying each other because each kidnapped the other's favorite mortal. Players lay out cards in opposite three-column, four-row matrices. Cards on the leading edges of the opposing columns can be used to attack, which means the combat value of the cards are compared and the loser is destroyed. However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards.

The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.&#10;&#10;The terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.&#10;&#10;Bin&acute;Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.&#10;&#10;One of the most exciting aspects of Bin&acute;Fa is the &quot;cavalry charge.&quot; As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.&#10;&#10;The game of Bin&acute;Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times. Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese general and student of warfare. Bin&acute;Fa is based on the precepts contained in his classic work on the subject, &quot;The Art of War,&quot; written 2,300 years ago. They provide the structural framework for the game.&#10;&#10;"
"Hey, That's My Fish!",Abstract Strategy,2,4,"In Hey, That's My Fish!, players want to catch as many fish as possible with their waddle of penguins. Each turn, a player moves one penguin in a straight line over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them. The player then collects the hex from where the penguin started its movement from the table, thereby creating a gap which penguins can't cross on future turns. When a penguin can't move, it's removed from play with its owner claiming the tile on which it stands. The player who collects the most fish wins.&#10;&#10;"
High Tail It!,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"In this geometrical racing game players maneuver teams of kangaroos jumping around a Billabong (&quot;a dead-end channel extending from the stream of a river,&quot; a term used in Australia).  The board is made up of checkerboard-style squares around the billabong in the middle.  On your turn you move one of your five kangaroos, usually moving it in a jump or series of jumps over the other kangaroos.  Jumps can be long; if the kangaroo to be jumped over is five spaces away, for example, the landing space will be five spaces beyond.  The other option, to move a kangaroo just one space, is usually used as a positioning tactic for a subsequent move.  The first player to get all five kangaroos around the billabong and over the finish line wins.&#10;&#10;"
Himalaya,Economic,3,4,"As the Chief of a Himalayan high plateau tribe; Dolpo-pa, Bhotia, Sherpa, or Tamang, you lead your yak's caravan from one village to another through snowy crests and risky paths in order to collect the goods necessary to the development of your tribe.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, you will increase the political, religious and economical influence of your tribe. By collecting goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, and gold), you can make offers to monasteries, send out delegations to different regions or bargain to increase your livestock. All this to become the most prosperous caravaneer in all of the Himalaya!&#10;&#10;Players program their caravans around the paths on the Himalayan plateau to collect various goods, and then deliver them.  Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.&#10;&#10;The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.  This unusual scoring is what makes this game different from many other similar games.&#10;&#10;"
Hive,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"From the Publisher:&#10;&#10;Hive is a highly addictive strategic game for two players that is not restricted by a board and can be played anywhere on any flat surface. Hive is made up of twenty two pieces, eleven black and eleven white, resembling a variety of creatures each with a unique way of moving.&#10;&#10;With no setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down. As the subsequent pieces are placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board). Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of the game is to totally surround your opponent's queen, while at the same time trying to block your opponent from doing likewise to your queen. The player to totally surround his opponent's queen wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
Hoity Toity,Bluffing,2,6,"What do bored English noblemen do with their free time?  Well, according to this Spiel des Jahres (1990) winner by Klaus Teuber, they like collecting old junk and then showing it off.  Players buy or steal various pieces of junk in the form of cards, trying to form the largest and oldest collection.  Built on a 'rock-paper-scissors' mechanism, this game gives all players a couple of choices each turn.  The trick is in guessing what your opponents are likely to do, and planning your choice accordingly -- only after everyone's decision is revealed do you know for certain whether you made the right one.&#10;&#10;Note: Hoity Toity (Uberplay, 2004) is for 3 to 6 players.&#10;      Spionage!

Igel Ärgern,Animals,2,6,"Translated literally, the title means &quot;Hedgehog Irking&quot; (or a bit more loosely, &quot;Annoying the Hedgehogs&quot;), but the game is usually referred to in English as &quot;Hedgehogs in a Hurry.&quot; This game gives players several wooden disks (the hedgehogs) to place in one of six rows.  During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space.  But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place.  The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins.  Some later versions of this game come with dozens of different variants to keep the game interesting.&#10;&#10;"

In the Shadow of the Emperor,Medieval,2,4,"In the Shadow of the Emperor is a tactical game for 2-4 players. Players represent aristocratic families at the Court of the Holy Roman Emperor. Players seek to get their family members into influential positions with the various electorships of the Empire. Once there they accumulate votes towards being elected to be Holy Roman Emperor. Players choose actions for their family members to take, which allow them to wrest control of the various Elector States (each of which has a special ability in addition to its voting power) whilst displacing their opponents. However, family members age and die and the number of action cards is limited, restricting the tactical options. As players build their influence they collect victory points and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"
In the Year of the Dragon,Economic,2,5,"Stefan Feld's 3rd game by Alea is In the Year of the Dragon.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of Chinese rulers around the year 1000. The game plays out in twelve rounds, with each round representing one month in a year that seems to go from bad to worse. Disease, drought, and attacks from the Mongols may claim lives, but make sure you have enough money to offer a tribute to the Emperor.&#10;&#10;The game play is easier than it may appear. Every player has a set of &quot;person&quot; cards. Each round, you choose one action (most of which call on your workers' abilities) help you prepare for the months ahead. Then you play one person card, recruiting that person and placing him into one of your palaces. Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year. (Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, Tax Collectors raise money, etc.) At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points.&#10;&#10;Careful planning is the key to surviving &quot;the year of the dragon,&quot; but survival alone may not win you the game.&#10;&#10;"
Industrial Waste,Economic,2,4,"Industrial Waste is a fast but deep game designed by J&#195;&#188;rgen Strohm in which the players are running factories. Players buy materials, complete orders and invest money in technology improvements to earn VPs, but they need to keep an eye on their waste output. If players have too much waste in their factory dump they are liable to suffer an environmental disaster and have to pay hefty cleanup costs. Development of technological improvements requiring less waste, fewer resources, and reduced workforce are the key to this game.&#10;&#10;The game features bidding for resources, hand management and some drafting of cards to gain actions. The first player to grow their factory to a value of twenty triggers the end and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"
Inkognito,Deduction,3,4,"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The goal of each agent in Inkognito is to complete a mission, together with his partner. At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!&#10;&#10;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When&#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.&#10;&#10;The &#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.&#10;&#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.&#10;&#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
Ivanhoe,Card Game,2,5,"Take on the role of a knight and join the prestigious tournaments at the king's court. Use your cards to win the jousting competitions, and to fight with your sword, axe or morning-star. Rally your squires, gain the support of a maiden, and play action cards against your opponents.&#10;&#10;Clever use of action cards can change the type of tournament that is in progress. One card will 'unhorse' you, forcing everyone still in the jousting competition to switch to a weapon battle of the action card holder&rsquo;s choice.&#10;&#10;Other actions cause you to drop whatever other weapon you are using and resort to hand-to-hand battles in which the player with the most cards- not the highest point total- will win a token. Depending on the number of players in the game, the first player to win four or five different tournaments becomes the overall victor.&#10;&#10;There is a lot more strategy involved in the game than first meets the eye.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Attacke&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Jenseits von Theben,Exploration,2,4,"This entry is for the original Jenseits von Theben; for the new printing by Queen, go to Thebes.&#10;&#10;Jenseits von Theben is a game of competitive archeology.  Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Macedonians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations.  Periodically, there are expositions at major European cities, and the archaeologist who shows up on time with the best collection of artifacts (plus a minor die roll) wins the purse.  The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and presents the biggest collection to the European exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact cards.  The game uses a novel mechanic to keep track of this -- there is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board, and each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time.  Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;.  So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact cards in each civilization are a hidden number.  The deck for each civilization contains twelve treasures of varying point values and two knowledge cards, with another sixteen cards of dirt.  At the beginning of the game, seven cards are removed from each deck without the players seeing them.  Through the course of the game, when a player excavates at a site, he or she keeps the artifacts that are revealed from a site, but the dirt is shuffled back into the remaining cards.  Both the imperfect information element as well as the recycled dirt make for a random chance element that is overcome somewhat by digging at a site where a player has much knowledge -- more knowledge means that more cards will be revealed in a shorter period of time, and a greater chance of revealing treasures that may yet remain after another player has already recovered some treasures from that site.&#10;&#10;The original run of Jenseits von Theben was hand-produced by Prinz Spiele in a first edition of 100, and a second edition of 300.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Thebes&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"

To do that, you'll need to play the right animal at the right time while anticipating what opponents will play, too.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a hand of sixteen cards: four each of elephant, dog, cat and mouse, with those cards valued 1-4. One card of each type starts in the center of the table. Each round, players choose one card from their hand, then reveal them simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Which animals are chased away is determined through a &quot;rock/paper/scissors&quot; format, with dogs chasing away cats, cats chasing away mice, mice chasing away elephants, and elephants chasing away dogs. If you play the only dog, for example, you collect all cats on the table and all cats played that turn; if multiple people play dogs, the strongest valued dog wins; if players play dogs of the same value, then those are ignored and the next strongest dog wins. Any animals not collected stay on the table for the next round.&#10;&#10;Once all the hand cards have been played, players tally the value of the animals they collected and whoever has teh highest sum wins!&#10;&#10;"

Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.&#10;&#10;The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     Arabana-Ikibiti&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     Kanaloa&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"

If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!&#10;&#10;Expanded/Reimplemented as:&#10;&#10;    Sole Mio! (a standalone game with similar game play)&#10;    Mamma Mia! Plus (which combines Mamma Mia! and Sole Mio! with a new ingredient and more cards for play with up to six)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Promo Expansion:&#10;&#10;    Mamma Mia: Double Ingredients (featuring Double Ingredients from Sole Mio!)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Marco Polo Expedition,Animals,2,5,"The objective of this game is to collect as much gold as possible while traveling a set path.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 3 gold and a hand of cards.&#10;&#10;The cards represent 4 different types of valuable goods and caravan handlers.&#10;&#10;Gold is collected along the path and at the midpoint of the game and the end (when the first player reaches Kantschou and then Daidu). The player reaching Kantschou first receives 6 gold, anyone in the next space receives 5 gold, and so on down to 1 gold. After the first scoring round all players start together again at Kantschou.  The first player to reach Daidu receives 7 gold, next space 6, then 5 and so on.&#10;&#10;Play is by matching cards from hand to requirements in next free space. eg one of each good, 3 cards the same colour. Caravans tend to leap frog forward, so one players move changes the requirements for the next. In each turn a player may move as often as they can match from their hand. For those really stuck with a poor hand, 1 gold will move your caravan one place forward, but only so long as they aren't the leading caravan.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn the active player draws one of five face-up cards or a random card from the draw pile to replenish their hand&#10;&#10;"
Marvel Heroes,Comic Book / Strip,2,4,"Marvel Heroes is a game set in the Marvel Universe for 2 to 4 players, with plenty of opportunities for cooperation and competition between the Super Heroes controlled by the players. Players take control of a group of Super Heroes (X-Men, Fantastic Four, Marvel Knights or the Avengers) as well as the Nemesis of one of the other player's group (Magneto, Dr. Doom, Kingpin or Red Skull). During the game, each player finds allies, enemies and power-ups, and face the menacing Super Villains controlled by the other players.&#10;&#10;High-quality plastic figures of many of the major Marvel Super Heroes, including Spider-Man, The Fantastic Four and The X-Men, as well as of the Nemesis characters, are included in the game. Each character featured in the game is represented by a detailed 40 mm plastic figure and an accompanying character card describing the character's special abilities. Power-ups can be added with special effects, which are different depending on who is acquiring these bonus items, so that all the different incarnations of the character can be played.&#10;&#10;"
Maskenball Venezia,Card Game,5,12,"Re-issue of Adlung's Maskenball, this time themed on a Venetian costume ball. Very nice cards. Rules in German, English &amp;  French.&#10;&#10;"
Master Labyrinth,Children's Game,2,4,"The 2007 dragon-themed re-implementation, also named Master Labyrinth, is quite different than the wizard-themed editions described below.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ravensburger Labyrinth Games series, This game is based on the simpler The aMAZEing Labyrinth game. It is played on a board with maze tiles (Straight's, L's, and T's) arranged on it.  Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns.  Players are wizards-in-training and they are charged with running around the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that the two chip cannot be taken until the one chip is taken, and the three chip cannot be taken until the two chip is taken, etc.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.  Once all twenty-one items have been taken, the highest total score wins.  But the 'Master' part of the game gives each player three ingredients which will give the player bonus points for grabbing.&#10;&#10;"
Mäuse-Rallye,Children's Game,2,4,"A game of flicking mice around a race track, while avoiding falling in the holes.  Once a player falls in a hole though, they temporarily become the cat, who will interfere with the remaining players until the round ends.  The winner is the mouse which collects the most cheese (earned by completing a circuit of the racetrack).&#10;&#10;Ages 5 and up&#10;&#10;"
Medieval Merchant,Economic,2,6,"Players secure valued markets via affordable trade routes between medieval cities while simultaneously forcing opponents into less affordable and less valued markets.  The cities themselves have a variable number of spaces for players to develop business branches within, or alternatively establish new trade routes into wider reaching cities and towns.  Players may generate income and risk losing dominance over a city, or add branches within a city that lower the value of your product but can award you with a stronger market influence.  At the end of the game, the player with the most influence wins.&#10;&#10;"
Merchant of Venus,Economic,1,6,"Merchant of Venus makes players take on the roles of space traders chasing wealth and fortune. Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.&#10;&#10;The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).&#10;&#10;Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.&#10;&#10;"
Metro,Trains,2,6,"Similar to Streetcar, Tsuro, Tantrix and Spaghetti Junction, this game has players putting square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Cable Car&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Meuterer,Card Game,3,4,"Meuterer is a role selection card game in which players take the roles of crewmembers aboard a merchant ship. Each round, each player reveals goods from their hands that they wish to sell. However, most ports deal in only one sort of goods, and it's the player who's the captain that gets to decide where the ships goes. That's where the mutineer comes in. If a player chooses to become the mutineer, they will try to become captain themself and may change the destination of the ship. Each player may also have an ally in the fight, and the side which played the most conflict points gets the final word on the ship's destination.&#10;&#10;Players can score points in various ways. Every time a player sells the most goods out of anyone in one place, or every time a player reaches their destination, either as the captain or as the mutineer, they score points. You also get points if you helped a side win during a mutiny. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
Modern Art,Card Game,3,5,"Buying and selling paintings is a very lucrative business, at least that's what Hollywood's led us to believe, and that's the premise of this game.  Five different artists have produced a bunch of paintings, and it's the player's task to be both the buyer and the seller, hopefully making a profit in both roles.  He does this by putting a painting from his hand up for auction each turn.  He gets the money if some other player buys it, but must pay the bank if he buys it for himself.  After each round, paintings are valued by the number of paintings of that type that were sold.  The broker with the most cash after four rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.&#10;&#10;"
Mole Hill,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"In this strange little game, players take the roles of a gardener protecting his lawn and a mole digging it up.  The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.&#10;&#10;Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.&#10;&#10;Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.&#10;&#10;"
Money!,Card Game,3,5,"The object of this Reiner Knizia card game is to collect as many of one type of currency as possible.  Players bid cards from their hands to exchange for 'lots' of cards, with the order being determined by whoever put out the highest valued cards.  The cards themselves are renditions of currencies from around the world.&#10;&#10;"
Monkey Madness,Animals,2,4,"The monkeys are in a mixed up mess! You'll need a bit of luck to sort them out and be the first to collect all of your monkeys.&#10;&#10;Players select monkeys out of the bag, placing them on the correct board (no matter who has that color).  The next player gets a turn after the current player finds a monkey of their own color.  First player to have 6 monkeys on their card is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
Muscat,Abstract Strategy,3,5,"Muscat can quickly be described as &quot;advanced rock-paper-scissors,&quot; but is much better than this  may make it sound.  There are 4 different types of items in this version, which are the different kinds of street performers in the marketplaces of Muscat.  The tiles representing the performers are placed in these marketplaces in such a way as to establish local dominance hierarchies, which are resolved by kicking the loser out on the street and promoting the winners to higher-class sections of Muscat.  Eventually, once can reach the Sultan's palace, and when enough performers have everyone scores points according to how high their performers have advanced up the board.&#10;&#10;There is more to it than that, of course.  The performers kicked out on the street want to get their revenge, and they can be placed back on the board or used to take 3 special actions which add a great deal of complexity to the game.  Although there is some randomness (in which tiles you pick when), this is essentially an abstract of the &quot;brain-burner&quot; school, and should be enjoyed by those who like that kind of  game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Message to the Czar&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Embody archaeologists seeking relics from ancient Egypt for powerful benefactors. Will you be convincing at the museum's final exhibition?&#10;&#10;The game takes place over four rounds. The game board is composed of four (or six in the last round) areas of two cards. These cards have 6 squares, possibly occupied by an obstacle (pyramid), and belonging to one of five benefactors (with their own color and symbol): Sir Brown, Lady Violet, Miss Blackmore, Lord Lemon and Colonel Tangerine.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own personal pool of archaeologists that can be used to:&#10;- Start an excavation (requiring one archaeologist)&#10;- Expand an excavation (requiring two archaeologists in addition to one archaeologist already on the board)&#10;- Play a benefactor previously earned&#10;- Pass&#10;&#10;Benefactors give special benefits like moving over an obstacle or retrieving archaeologists faster, etc ...&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed, we resolve the board according to area control. The player in the first position can either take a card available or go to the museum. Other players can then do the same. Ties are resolved according to player order.&#10;&#10;Going to the Museum adds value for a colour at endgame to the cards collected (x2, x3 or x5).&#10;&#10;At the end of the 4th round, the final exhibition is resolved and the winning player will be whoever collected the most prestige between:&#10;- Points on the cards collected during game&#10;- Points by colour benefactors (according to position in the museum)&#10;- Bonus points for sets of cards (1 in every colour of benefactors).&#10;&#10;"

Navegador,Economic,2,5,"This game is inspired by the Portuguese Age of Discoveries in the 15th-16th century. Players take actions such as contracting men, acquiring ships and buildings, sailing the seas, establishing colonies in discovered lands, trading goods on the market, and getting privileges.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with only two ships and three workers and tries to expand his wealth.&#10;&#10;There are several undiscovered lands that allow players, once discovered, to found some colonies there. Colonies exist in different places where sugar, gold and spices are available and can be sold to the market to make some money. Money is used to build ships, erect buildings such as factories, shipyards and churches, and to get workers. Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire  buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining his privileges with his achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
Neue Spiele im alten Rom,Abstract Strategy,2,7," Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.&#10;&#10;(7 of the games are described below)&#10;&#10;The Wheel of History : 2-5 players&#10;&#10;This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.&#10;&#10;The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players&#10;&#10;This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Mercator : 3-7 players&#10;&#10;This game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.&#10;&#10;Imperium : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.&#10;&#10;Senator : 2-3 players&#10;&#10;You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.&#10;&#10;Consul : 2-4 players&#10;&#10;This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.&#10;&#10;Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome&#10;&#10;"

Nuba,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"The board is a 5 x 6 grid. Each player has ten tokens, numbered 1 - 9 and one 'X'. Players alternate setting their pieces in the two rows nearest them. The lower the number on the token, the better a wrestler that piece is. The higher the number, the better the musician (but that makes that piece a lousy wrestler). The idea is to get your highest possible piece to the opposite side of the board.&#10;&#10;When a piece successfully reaches the opposite side of the board, it is placed in the honorable musician space. It remains there unless another piece (of either player) with a higher value reaches the opposite side, in which case it supplants this piece as the best musician. The game ends when no one can oust the reigning musician (which means no one has a piece left on the board of a higher value). If a player's piece marked with the 'X' reaches the opposite side, the game immediately ends and that player is victorious.&#10;&#10;"

Octi,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"Octi is an abstract strategy game that is similar to checkers and chess.  The object of the game is move your pieces into your opponent's starting points.  The difference between checkers and Octi is that this game allows for multiple jumping, capturing, and special movement of pieces.  On each move players decide whether to bring in new pieces, upgrade their existing pieces, or move a piece.  The choices in this game are staggering and each move presents and entire new way of thinking about the game.

Odin's Ravens,Animals,2,2,"Each morning Odin sends the ravens Hugin and Munin to race over the world of Midgard and report back what they have seen. The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth.&#10;&#10;Odin's Ravens is a two-player card game in which two ravens race across separate tracks, the tracks being comprised of domino-style landscape cards that feature different types of land. Each player has his own deck of cards, using them to match cards to the land types in front of his raven and advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin Cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven. During play, each player can create an auxiliary stack, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future.&#10;&#10;The round ends when a raven reaches the end of the flight path, and that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points. The game lasts multiple rounds until one of the players reaches a total of twelve or more points and wins!&#10;&#10;"
"Oh, Pharaoh!",Ancient,3,4,"From the publisher:&#10;&#10;On behalf of the all-powerful pharaoh, the best architects of their time are building pyramids as burial grounds for the divine king. However, a battle between the master builders erupts: who constructs the biggest, most beautiful and magnificent pyramids? Envy and conspiracy are the order of the day and thus the architects make life difficult for each other.&#10;&#10;Each player tries to erect as many high-quality pyramids as possible. The player whose turn it is receives a new building card. He then can swap cards with the other players. He or she may then lay down cards to a pyramid or continue building at a pyramid already in progress. A pyramid is created when it consists of at least two rows of cards on top of each other. Each row consists of building cards with the same number. The row on top always has fewer cards than the ones below. The result is a continuous row of numbers from top to bottom.&#10;&#10;When it's their turn, players have to decide if they want to have their pyramids evaluated. The cards will then be taken away and the number of points marked down. Apart from the building cards, there are &quot;thieves&quot; with whom one can steal cards out of other player's pyramids, &quot;tax collectors&quot; who steal hand held cards and the &quot;pharaoh&quot; who can prevent these actions from taking place!&#10;&#10;"

Othello,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"Trap other pieces between your own to capture them, but be aware that the opponent may do the same. Pieces will change sides (colors) dozens of times. The winner is the one with the most pieces when no more pieces can be played on the board.&#10;&#10;In Hong Kong, an advertising campaign by Texwood for its Apple Jeans involved the use of Othello sets, retitled Ping Guo Qi (Apple Chess). The sucess of the campaign raised the popularity of the game, and Ping Guo Qi or Apple Chess has since become an alternative name for Hei Bai Qi (Black and White Chess), the more traditional name for the game.&#10;&#10;Goro Hasegawa changed Setup of Reversi a bit and renamed it as Othello inspired from Shakespeare's play.&#10;&#10;"
Pagoda,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"A five-in-a-row game where each player has five pieces.    All the lines of five cross at the center piece, so it turns into a struggle for the control of the center of the board.  The pieces are 6-sided dice, and the up face determines how the piece can move.  When a piece is captured, it is rerolled and can enter play in its new form (i.e. it is reincarnated).  One of the pieces, the Buddah, is actually not played on the board, but instead fills a blank spot, acting as a wild card.&#10;&#10;"
Pente,Abstract Strategy,2,6,"Pente is an abstract strategy game.  Players place glass markers on intersections of a 19-by-19 grid (the same as in Go).  The object of the game is to get five of your own markers in a row (4 with more than 2 players) or capture five pairs of your opponent's pieces.  The first to do either wins.  Capturing takes place when exactly two pieces are sandwiched between pieces of the opposite color. There are multiple variations of the game for greater challenge and complexity.  The 20th anniversary edition is a deluxe version of the game with a large color game instruction book, quality game board, and six sets of different colored glass markers that allows play with up to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Other five-in-a-row games include Go-Moku and Renju (which do not feature capturing), and Ninuki-Renju (which does).&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    5ive Straight&#10;    Take 5&#10;    5 in a Row&#10;    Go-Moku&#10;    Renju&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Phoenix,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"The game contains a forest of wood:  6 &ldquo;light spectrum&rdquo; large cubes in different colors and thirty smaller pawns, 5 each in six different colors that match the larger cubes.  There are also fifty cards that determine the movement of the pawns and cubes, a cloth bag in which to place the pawns and a board onto which the cubes and twenty of the pawns will be placed.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, the six large cubes are arranged randomly on the spaces provided in the center of the board.  Then, the thirty pawns are mixed inside the cloth bag.  Twenty pawns are drawn randomly, with ten being placed on each side of the board.  Each player is then dealt five cards.&#10;&#10;The objective in Phoenix is to arrange your ten pawns in the same color sequence as the six large cubes.  Playing a card allows you to move or swap pawns within your row, or exchange one pawn with your opponent. There are also three cards which allow you to change the order of the central cube pattern.&#10;&#10;The round ends when one player's pawns match the central pattern. That player receives five points. Victory points are also awarded to both players based on having 3, 4 or 5 pawns of the same color connected, and using one of every color. A game lasts three rounds.&#10;&#10;"
Pick Picknic,Animals,2,6,"&quot;A corn, please!&quot; is the cry heard from many fowl mouths at the cold buffets in the many poultry yards. Game hens, pheasants, ducks, geese, and turkeys seem to be always hungry - never getting enough to eat. In Pick Picknic, a real feast awaits them! The fox is also always hungry and ready to eat, but from a somewhat different menu,... Chickens, geese, and ducks, become happily plump when they are able to eat well and often.

Pickomino,Animals,2,7,"Two to seven players, ages 8 and up try to obtain fried worms for their chickens, so that they don't go hungry. Of course, anyone who doesn't manage to grab a worm off of the grill can help himself to those of his opponents. This fast-paced game by Reiner Knizia is, like Hick Hack im Gackelwack, a gambling game in the finest chicken tradition.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each turn players roll their dice and set aside all those matching any single value. The remaining dice are rolled and any value is set aside again until the player stops and takes a tile or busts and puts their last tile back. When a player busts and fails to take a tile they must also turn the highest tile face-down.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, the German edition from Zoch has English rules in the box.&#10;&#10;The Dutch edition is part of the Jakkie &amp; Bak Collection&#10;The German edition is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch.&#10;&#10;"
Pico 2,Card Game,2,2,"from game review:&#10;&#10;The  game is composed of 11 cards. These are numbered 4 through 13 plus 16 and each also bears a number of &quot;pips&quot;. (From one on the 4 card to four on the 16 card.) A round is played as follows: each player is dealt 5 cards with the eleventh card discarded face-up. (Note that this means that you know exactly what cards your opponent holds.) Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared. There are, at most, fourteen card plays in a game and so the game is usually over in two or three minutes.&#10;&#10;"
Piratenbillard,Action / Dexterity,2,4,"This interesting dexterity game is played on a table-like board that is a wooden lattice with a piece of linen stretched over the bottom.  Little colored balls are placed in the resulting holes, and then players use long wooden mallets to strike the bottom of the table.  When a ball is hit correctly, it will pop out of the space it's in and land in another space closer to the opposite side of the board.  Landing on another player's ball lets you capture it, but if your ball lands off the board, it's out of the game.&#10;&#10;"
Pizarro & Co.,Exploration,3,6,"Players are kings (or queens) bidding for the services of six famous explorers -- Ferdinand Magellan, Christopher Columbus, Francisco Pizarro, Vasco da Gama, James Cook, and Marco Polo. As the game progresses, competition for the explorers' services increases as each explorer has fewer expeditions available for investment. In the end, only one ship for each explorer makes the final trip and only one king earns those rewards.&#10;&#10;Firstly, the board is set up from two double-sided boards, giving four possible configurations with slightly different versions of each explorer. Each player has six ships and money cards numbered 1 to 9. There are three turns. In the first, each explorer has 3 ships, but only two of these will proceed to the second turn and only one will win through to the third.&#10;&#10;A set of cards with explorers is used for each turn - 3 of each explorer in turn one, 2 of each in turn two and 1 of each in the last turn. The top card is revealed and an auction held, going round the table until all but one player has passed. The winning bidder puts the card in front of them and places one of their ships on to the relevant explorer area on the board. This process is repeated until all the cards have been bid on.&#10;&#10;Each explorer has a different power, some giving victory points, others money or a special ability like being able to delay a subsequent auction, or a combination of these. At the end of a turn players gain two new money cards, plus any which explorers they have a ship on give them. The second turn work in the same way, but only players with a ship invested in an explorer can bid on it, and because there are only two ships of the three on each explorer moving to the second area, one will be left behind. Similarly, the third round sees just one ship of the remaining two move to the third and final area for each explorer. Scoring is then done, with more points available for players with ships reaching the third area.&#10;&#10;Money is always tight so it is a good idea to try and get some extra income, though this conflicts with the need to score points. Two of the explorers score a lot of points but have no income so each player must balance the two needs. Money cards are worth points as well, so there is also a trade off between using these to win auctions to advance your ships and keeping them to score with.&#10;&#10;"
Portobello Market,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"London, 1901. At the world famous Portobello Market, the goal in the morning is to secure the best places to build stalls.

Primordial Soup,Prehistoric,3,4,"The Primordial Soup is supposedly where all life came from.  Players take charge of a tribe of amoeba as they struggle to survive.  In order to help their quest, tribes will take various genetic advantages, which allow them to 'break' the rules of life.  For instance, instead of going hungry, your amoeba could learn to attack foreign amoeba for food.  Or perhaps your amoeba could be taught to need less food to survive.  Either way, this is a very interesting take on the game of life.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Primordial Soup: Freshly Spiced&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Princes of the Renaissance,Economic,3,6,"Princes of the Renaissance is set in Renaissance Italy. Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.&#10;&#10;No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore.&#10;&#10;"
Programmer's Nightmare,Card Game,2,6,"In this game, players take turns laying out program instructions with &quot;ownership bits&quot; on the cards they play, creating a long line of interrelating program instructions that become more complicated as the program builds. Finally, a player will play a RUN card and set the program running. Who will survive the convolutions of the program? That's anyone's guess; each player decides if and how their own program instructions will function!&#10;&#10;There is a &quot;Version 2&quot; of the game in the rules; the program is dealt out at random in a loop, the players take turns claiming instructions that they think will let them win the game. Much of this game's strategy is based upon the initial selection of Program Instructions. Version two involves much more strategy and less luck.&#10;&#10;"
Prosperity,Economic,2,4,"You're the leader of a great nation which is currently expanding. Over the course of the seven decades covered by the game, you will have to invest in infrastructures and industries, provide your country with energy and finance the mercurial forces of research in order to remain competitive.&#10;&#10;But prosperity has a price. You owe it to future generations to leave them a healthy world. Pollution lurks, but will you be able to limit it?&#10;&#10;Prosperity has players building up their countries on a grand but abstract scale, with them needing to balance concerns over energy and ecology with the constant need for capital and the long-term goal of prosperity points.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 24 tiles available, half on the energy side of the shared game board and half on the ecology side. Two tiles on each side are placed on levels 1-6, with the players each having two research markers &ndash; energy and ecology &ndash; that start at level 1. Each player has an individual game board with color-coded spaces for tiles, a pollution track, and tracks for energy and ecology. A stack of 36 tiles &ndash; with tiles arranged by decades: the six from 2030 on the bottom, then the five from 2020, and so on to the five from 1970 &ndash; is set up during the playing area.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top tile from the stack, then everyone resolves the symbol highlighted on the tile:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Energy &ndash; for a positive value, earn money; for a negative value, lose money or increase your pollution&#10;    Ecology &ndash; remove or add discs to your pollution track&#10;    Capital &ndash; earn money for each capital symbol on the tiles you own&#10;    Research &ndash; advance one research marker one space for each research symbol on tiles you own&#10;    Prosperity &ndash; score points for each prosperity symbol on tiles you own, but only if your pollution isn't maxed out&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has done this, the active player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take money.&#10;    Remove one pollution marker.&#10;    Move forward one space on one research track.&#10;    Buy a tile, with the amount owed being based on whether the tile is energy or ecology and the level of your corresponding research marker. If you buy a tile of the same level, the cost is &euro;100; if the tile is of a higher level, you pay &euro;100, plus &euro;100 for each level; and if the tile is lower, you pay a flat &euro;50.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players have limited space for tiles on their individual boards, especially since the tiles and spaces are color-coded, but players can cover existing tiles, if desired, losing any benefits (or penalties) in the process. Some parts of the individual board are off-limits to new infrastructure until you first provide transport; toll roads, highways and even train systems have drawbacks of their own, but ideally you'll be able to build your way past those trouble spots without causing too much pollution.&#10;&#10;When the final tile is drawn, that player finishes his turn, then everyone scores: twice for their energy and ecology levels, one for capital (with money being converted into prosperity points), once for research on both tracks (with points for those researching the most), and once for prosperity. Whoever tallies the most prosperity points wins!&#10;&#10;"
Pueblo,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"Pueblo - the ultimate building challenge! Work with the other players to create a mighty home for the Chieftain, stone by stone. You are a craftsman, but you cannot let the Chieftain see your trademark stones, or you will be penalized. The longer you play, the more difficult this task becomes! Take on your opponents and become the Chieftain's Master Builder.&#10;&#10;The theme setting is the Native American Pueblos of the Southwest tribes of the Zuni and Hopi. The board is a fairly small square. Each player gets a number of building blocks in their own color, and also some neutral colored blocks (1 fewer than the colored). Starting with the odd colored block, the player places it on the board, and then gets to move the &quot;Chieftain&quot;  around the outer track surrounding the board. If the Chieftain can look straight across and see any colored blocks, those players gain points -- but points are bad. And when the Chieftain lands on the corners of the track, he looks down on the Pueblo from above, and all visible player's blocks gain them more points. Now, on each subsequent pair of turns, you have a choice of a colored block and a neutral block. Once all players' blocks are played, the Chieftain makes one last trip around the board, players gaining points all along the way. The player who has gained the fewest number of points is the Master Builder and the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;There are also some extra components for making the game more challenging by adding an element of bidding for turn order, and from 1 to 4 sacred sites that cannot be built upon.&#10;&#10;Original description from box.&#10;&#10;"

Race for the Galaxy: Rebel vs Imperium,Card Game,1,6,"This second expansion for Race for the Galaxy delves into the growing conflict between the Rebel and Imperium forces. Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm expansion is optional, but is strongly recommended and adds solo play. Rebel vs Imperium adds an extra player so with the 1st expansion allows 6-player game. The drafting variant now supports 2-5 players (instead of just 2-3 with The Gathering Storm).&#10;&#10;This expansion increases player interaction by adding takeover rules that allow players to conquer military worlds in other players' tableaus, though players who refrain from playing certain cards are immune to conquest. A new &quot;Mix and Match Explore&quot; power allows a player to combine the explore cards with their hand before discarding.  Three new start worlds increase the number of start worlds to 12 and allow players a choice of a military or non-military start world.  New goals are also included.  Finally there is a 2-player Rebel vs Imperium scenario.&#10;&#10;"
Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm,Card Game,1,5,"The Gathering Storm is the first expansion for Race for the Galaxy and adds new cards, an additional player, goals to compete over, as well as solitaire and drafting rules.  It also includes some blank cards for players to make their own cards.&#10;&#10;The new cards include four start worlds, three 6-cost developments, two other new developments (and one duplicate development), five military worlds and six non-military worlds (including a replacement gambling world).  Goals consist of  &lsquo;First Goals&rsquo;, which reward the first player to achieve an objective with 3 extra VP, and &lsquo;Most Goals&rsquo; reward the player with the most developments, military or certain types of worlds.  An extra set of player cards and VP chips allows for a 5th player, and a robot template, dice, and chits allows for a solitaire game.  Finally drafting rules provide a different way of playing the game for 2 or 3 players.&#10;&#10;"
Raj,Animals,2,5,"Rarely is a game broken down to its barest elements like this one (one of the others being For Sale).  Raj was originally printed as Hol's der Geier. Its main 'simultaneous action' mechanism has been used numerous times: most recently as Sky Runner, or Olympia 2000 (v. Chr.), or even For Sale to a certain extent.  Players are given an equal deck of cards from one to fifteen.  Each turn, a prize tile is randomly selected from a pool.  The prize tile either has positive or negative points, and each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining fifteen cards, and reveal them simultaneously.  The highest card gets the prize (if positive), or the lowest card get the prize (if negative).  However, if two people play the highest (or lowest) card, they cancel each other out and the prize goes to the next in line...&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;      Boardspace.net Real time, against humans or robot players&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Relationship Tightrope,Card Game,3,5,"This game is a relative of the Raj/Hols der Geier family of games, the german title means Tightrope.  Each turn, a number of red and blue sticks are up for grabs.  The highest card played will take the blue sticks and the lowest card will take the red sticks.  The trick is that a red stick cancels a blue stick (that is, a well balanced tightrope walker), and the goal is to score as few points as possible.  However, there are two different ways of playing the game, depending on how players wish to play: strategic or otherwise.  The basic game has players simultaneously playing cards (ala Raj), whereas the strategic version plays like a trick-taking game with players selecting a card sequentially.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Yin Yang/Fifty-Fifty&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Relic Runners,Exploration,2,5,"In Relic Runners, each player takes on the role of a character keen to exploit and acquire relics that have been unearthed in a long lost part of the jungle. Each would-be archaeologist has a colorful past &mdash; retired university professor, former army captain, etc. &mdash; and wants to be the first to get their hands on the precious loot to earn the most victory points.&#10;&#10;Players must navigate a series of paths in order to visit temples. The archaeologists are restricted in their movement by their access to rations, but thankfully they can place markers on paths to allow them to travel for free in future turns. The players also have a toolkit that can be upgraded in three particular ways to break the rules in some way or offer them an advantage as they move around.&#10;&#10;Each time a player visits a temple, he takes a token. Initially the temples offer up victory points or some form of in-game bonus. When the final token is taken, a relic is placed there to be collected. The players earn large victory points for collecting relics of different types (set collection) and players can also earn bonus points for creating long routes and traveling along these to collect relics.&#10;&#10;"
Ricochet Robots,Abstract Strategy,1,15,"Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible. There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.&#10;&#10;"

Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory.  The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera.  But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;"
Rolling Japan,Dice,1,99,"Rolling Japan is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of Japan that's divided into the 47 prefectures, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild purple die. All players now write down each number rolled on any prefecture of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue prefecture and a 2 in one yellow prefecture. If the purple die is rolled, you can place this number in a prefecture of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-purple die as any color. However, neighboring prefectures &mdash; including those in different areas connected by blue lines &mdash; can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a prefecture of the appropriate color. (If all the prefectures in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&#10;&#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round.

The end of each of the five rounds is also marked by a highly variable fight to claim the best sleeping spaces on board the ship (bed or board?). The game is a mixture of tactics, strategy, and luck. The die plays an important role in the game, but you still get the feeling of being at the mercy of fate only rarely.&#10;&#10;The game contains 76 plastic pirate figures, 9 game board pieces that ensure the board is always different, about 200 tiles, and 1 die.&#10;&#10;Description adapted from the Gamewire Essen Preview.&#10;&#10;This game is #10 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;"
Saint Petersburg,Age of Reason,2,4,"On May 16th, 1703, Czar Peter laid the cornerstone for the first building in Saint Petersburg. Quickly, glorious buildings were added, always being expanded, so that Nobility (bringing victory points) may want to move in. But to accomplish this, one needs merchants who can bankroll the necessary Rubles, or the glory is over. The competition isn't sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose.&#10;&#10;Saint Petersburg has a board to tally victory points and to set out the four types of cards.  It is the cards themselves that players need to collect.  In each round &ndash; with the number of rounds dependent on the number of players and the randomness of card availability &ndash; players first pay for CRAFTSMEN who supply money for further purchases; then BUILDINGS to score points; then ARISTOCRATS, who are needed for money, points, and end-of-game scoring; and finally, unique cards from all three categories which give greater benefits. During the first rounds, players never have enough money to buy every card they want.

San Juan,Card Game,2,4,"San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and &quot;violet&quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.&#10;&#10;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.&#10;&#10;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked.

The game uses a card distribution mechanic whereby (in the case of a four-player game) two players draw cards and divide them up into two piles each, the other two players pick one group and the remaining groups go to the players who formed the groups. The action cards allow players to place and remove aristocrats, erect and move bridges, and score individual regions. The entire game lasts three Passages and each Passage may contain several turns.&#10;&#10;62 Action cards:&#10;   30 District (5 for each district)&#10;    6 Bridge&#10;   12 Transfer&#10;   10 Doge&#10;    4 Banishment&#10;&#10;28 Limit cards:&#10;   8 X &quot;1&quot;&#10;   10 X &quot;2&quot;&#10;   10 X &quot;3&quot;&#10;&#10;Related game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Canal Grande is a two-player card game based on this game.&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Santiago,Farming,3,5,"This game is about cultivating and watering fields. To accomplish this, a number of tiles denoting various plantation types come into the game each round.  The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile&rsquo;s yield will be.  Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round.  The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money.  The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like.  Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground.  At game&rsquo;s end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type &ndash; the bigger the better.  But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players.&#10;&#10;"
Saturn,Action / Dexterity,2,4,Players take turns placing various sized wooden balls on the carefully balanced structure that resembles the rings of Saturn.  Players must attempt to place their balls on the rings without making the ring touch the table.  Higher points are scored if balls are placed on the outer ring.  Also heavier balls score higher as well.&#10;&#10;
Scarab Lords,Ancient,2,2,"Excerpted from publisher's blurb:&#10;&#10;&quot;The Age of the Locust is at hand. Foreboding shadows arise form the desert of endless storms. Dark magics stir in the silent streets, and words of ancient prophecy have come true; the Scarab Lords have come forth to wage war in the Heavens and on the Earth.&quot;&#10;&#10;Set in a gorgeous fantasy Egypt, this clever card game depicts the battle of dominance between two mythical Scarab Lords. To win, power must be gained in the areas of religion, military, and economics. Powerful sorcerers, mythical beasts, epic monuments, and grand armies all play key roles in the Scarab Lords card game.&#10;&#10;The non-collectible card game features two beautifully illustrated 30 card decks which players must customize to best fit their strategies.&#10;&#10;Sequel: Minotaur Lords&#10;&#10;"
Schrille Stille,Economic,3,6,"Players are the heads of 1 of 6 fictitious music companies, trying to predict/influence the popularity of 14 different musical acts. Each turn, players get 7 chits with +/- values on them, 5 of which they may use to secretly vote for the bands they want to support. Players are awarded points at the end of a round if one of their bands is in the top 6 slots. Players also have 2 special chits that either award extra points if played on a band that jumps to #1, or add/deduct points based on how far up (or down) a band moves from its original position. Some bands in the last 4 slots are removed at the end of a round depending on their original board position, and the top 3 are removed (one-hit wonders) once a player's score reaches the 30 and 50 point mark. The game ends once a player reaches 70 points total. Very nice artwork and goofy band names (as only the Germans can do it) are complemented by one of the cooler game components ever; a wooden &quot;CD Player&quot; that the DJ (dealer) uses to tally up the votes.&#10;&#10;Please be aware that, although this was formerly listed as a family game, the band names feature adult language.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     BrettspielWelt (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;"
SET,Card Game,1,20,"In SET, each card contains 1-3 objects, with all of the objects on a card having the same color, shape and shading, e.g., two purple shaded ovals. Colors, shapes, and shadings come in three different types: green, purple and red; oval, diamond and squiggle; and solid, shaded and outlined.&#10;&#10;All players compete simultaneously and try to claim sets of cards in a single pass through the deck. A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute. For example, if all three cards have the same number of objects, but three different shapes, shadings, and colors, then those cards are a set; if two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set.&#10;&#10;To play, one person takes the deck and lays out twelve cards face up. The first person to spot a set collects those three cards; if the player was mistaken, then this player cannot claim a set until after another player has done so. After someone has claimed a set, the cardholder lays out three more cards. (If all players agree that no sets can be claimed, then the cardholder lays out three more cards. These cards aren't replaced after someone claims a set.) Whoever claims the most sets wins!&#10;&#10;"
Shear Panic,Animals,2,4,"The second game from Fragor Games, featuring a flock of sheep and their attempts to be in the right place at the right time.

Bright summer days filled with games of tag and attempts to flock closer to Roger, the Heartthrob Ram? But, Watch Out! The shearer wants to drag you away from all the fun and games!&#10;&#10;In Shear Panic, ewe maneuver your ewes to score points, playing tag, standing close to Roger, or trying to avoid the shearing scissors! Will your brave sheep score the most points, or will it be &quot;Off with the wool&quot; for ewe?&quot;&#10;&#10;The game includes eleven small figurines (which are somewhat fragile): Two each of four different colors, one black, one 'Roger', and one 'Shearer'. Also included are four player mats in different colors; a timing/scoring mat; 48 mutton buttons in four colors; four scoring markers; one flock marker; and two special six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;There are two separate play areas: The one where the flock of sheep figurines are clustered; and the combination timing/scoring mat. (The timing mat is two-sided for 3 or 4 players.) Actions by the players each turn cause the timing marker to move faster or slower through each of the four fields, and the scoring is different in each field.&#10;&#10;Field 1 is Team Tag. Players score higher for keeping their sheep closer together. Field 2 is Roger&rsquo;s Field, where players score more the closer they are to Roger (the ram). Field 3 is Black Sheep Tag, and players score higher the closer they are to the black sheep. Field 4 is the Shear Panic Field, and the row of sheep closest to the shearer figure are eliminated each turn, while the remainder are scored individually. The timing marker indicates which Field the sheep are currently &ldquo;in&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Players have a total of twelve actions they may take during the course of the game, and as each one is used, a &ldquo;mutton button&rdquo; is placed over it, eliminating it from future use. Also, the more powerful the action, the farther (faster) the timing marker will move. If the timing marker lands on a red spot, the active player executes a free &ldquo;lamb slam&rdquo; by rolling the Panic Die and moving a sheep of the color rolled one space in any direction. If the Panic Die rolls white, the entire flock does a &ldquo;ewe turn&rdquo; ninety degrees in a direction of the active player&rsquo;s choice.&#10;&#10;Since all the player mats are visible to everyone, players need to keep an eye on what moves are still available to their opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is intended for three or four players, but rules for a two-player variant are included.&#10;&#10;Starting player is the person who most recently was sheared (had their hair cut).&#10;&#10;"
Sheepland,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"Sheepland is set on the beautiful island of the same name, where for centuries the population has taken care of sheep. While inexplicably working in the same field, two to four shepherds try to move sheep into the right areas to score points. During a turn, you must take three actions, chosen from these possibilities:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move your shepherd&#10;    Move one sheep&#10;    Buy one terrain tile&#10;&#10;&#10;You must move your shepherd at least once during your turn, and you can't take the same action twice in a row without moving the shepherd between.&#10;&#10;Six different terrain types are available, with five tiles of each type and increasing costs (from 0 to 4 dinars) on those tiles. When you buy a tile, you're not claiming land on the game board, but rather investing in that type of landscape as that's where you expect the sheep to end up grazing. At the end of the game, you score 1 point per tile of a terrain type for each sheep in a region of this type; you also score for coins still in hand.&#10;&#10;The map on the game board shows regions separated by roads: three regions of each terrain type for a total of 18 regions. Numbered &quot;rest stops&quot; lie along the roads, with each rest stop between exactly two regions. Shepherds move from one rest stop to another, with the first movement being free and all others on the same turn costing 1 coin. When you buy a terrain, you can purchase the top tile of either of the two terrain types next to your shepherd. When you move a sheep, you move one sheep from a region adjacent to your shepherd to the other region adjacent to that piece, i.e., you lead the sheep across the road to a greener pastures &ndash; well, greener for you, if all goes well.&#10;&#10;Each time you move the shepherd, you place a fence in the rest stop from which it started moving, making that location off-limits for the rest of the game. During the game some regions become inaccessible, and if they are full of sheep, naturally there's a rush for the tiles. The lone black sheep in the game, which is worth two points, serves as a semi-random element, possibly moving to an adjacent region each turn while still being movable by shepherds as long as it's not fenced in.&#10;&#10;After twenty fences have been placed, you end the round so that all players have the same number of turns, then you count up the points.&#10;&#10;"
Show Manager,Card Game,2,6,"The players put together four shows in any order: Queenie, Wolf, King Lear, and Ballet.  To accomplish this, players draft actor cards from a constantly changing queue of cards.  Each card represents actors of varying skills at roles.  Once a player puts together all the needed roles for a show, the value is judged against all the other productions of that type, with points given relative to the other productions.&#10;&#10;This is a Queen Games reprint of the db-Spiele original, Premiere.&#10;&#10;"

Space Alert,Electronic,1,5,"Space Alert is a cooperative team survival game. Players become crew members of a small spaceship scanning dangerous sectors of galaxy. The missions last just 10 real-time minutes (hyperspace jump, sector scan, hyperspace jump back) and the only task the players have is to protect their ship.&#10;&#10;During play, the central computer will announce the presence of various threats on one the supplied 10 minute soundtracks that also acts as a game timer. The threats vary from space battleships and interceptors to different interstellar monsters and abominations, asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree who will take care of which task and coordinate their actions (moving around the ship, firing weapons, distributing energy, using battlebots to deal with intruders, launching guided missiles, etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety.&#10;&#10;The game offers several difficulty levels, huge variability and a unique experience for one to five player teams.

Space Beans,Card Game,2,6,"This game is a successor to the popular Bohnanza but is less complex and is not based on trading.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to collect 30 points in &quot;trophies&quot; to win the game. This is accomplished by working with up to two collections of space beans - 1 public (face-up) and 1 secret (face-down).&#10;&#10;The primary mechanic is drawing beans, placing them in one of your collections (public or secret) if you have any matching cards to play, then passing your entire hand to the player on your right. If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.&#10;&#10;For example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points. The card numbered 3 would go into the trophy pile, and the other cards into the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Space Beans is part of the Bohnanza family of games.&#10;&#10;"

They race to generate goods and deliver them to each other (earning victory points for both the player and the recipient) or to the neutral planets. They can also do research to improve their abilities and bring new cards into play. Everything &ndash; from generating goods to moving ships,to playing new cards &ndash; requires at least one flip of a sand timer; the catch is that each player has only two timers!&#10;&#10;At the start of the game it seems like you have all the time in the world.

You have 5 attempts to get a goal, as long as the ball keeps returning to you.  But if you put too much speed on it, it'll fly off the other side as there's no backstop in this game, only side rails.  If you can manage to curl it all the way into your opponents 'end zone' and make it come back into the goal, you get two points.  But instead of taking a point, you can set up a blocker instead, to try to protect your goal.  Comes with each players yoke like ball holder and rubber shooting implement with a small wooden handle.

If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card&mdash;in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it&mdash;you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.&#10;&#10;All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points.

Step by Step,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"Step by Step uses excellent components to create a climbing game requiring thoughtful placement and sound planning. The game board is a square frame holding nicely-made square pieces. To begin, the frame is populated with one level of pieces on all spaces, except for the center on which five pieces are stacked and stabilized with a rod through the middle. Each player gets a large ball that fits on the hole in the pieces, and the starting position is determined based on the number of players (2-4).&#10;&#10;With the goal being to get your ball onto the center tower, you progress by moving your ball anywhere on the same level you start and then placing another piece on an adjacent space (adding a level to that space.) You can move down the structure for free as long as you don't skip a level, but once you move onto a higher level in your turn it is over. Using this mechanism, players try to craft a path to the top of the tower that can't be used by others or use their ball as a blocking point to keep someone off the level you need.&#10;&#10;"

Ta Yü,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"In Ta Y&uuml;, a sumptuously produced game of connections, one side tries to extend from the starting tile in the center to reach the western and eastern edges of the board while the opposing side tries to reach the northern and southern edges.  On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.&#10;&#10;Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.&#10;&#10;"

By influencing the prominent forces, building magnificent palaces, and ensuring a steady supply of commodities, the princes increase their power until the most successful has won.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to gain the most influence points. These can be obtained by building palaces and by acquiring commodities. A palace can be built after securing the support of the Vizier, the General, the Monk, the Princess, or the Grand Mogul. Commodities are gained by seizing control of a region or by retrieving them on a space where a palace has just been built.&#10;&#10;There are twelve turns with an auction for the region control and the support of the Vizier, General, Monk, Princess, and Grand Mogul, each represented by a different symbol. Players use cards in four colors to bid for the various prizes, and each player may only play one color in any given turn. During your turn you can either increase your bid by playing more cards or withdraw. When you do, you gain the reward for every symbol you have the majority of. You place palaces, gain region tiles, and increase your score accordingly. There are bonus points for connecting palaces over several regions on the map.After the final area on the board is auctioned, the player with the highest point total wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is #3 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;"
Tal der Könige,Ancient,2,4,"When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks, you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional.  The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.  The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Final round 1990 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.&#10;&#10;"
Tally Ho!,Animals,2,2,"What happens when the hunter becomes the hunted?&#10;&#10;In Tally Ho!, one player takes the role of the hunters and the lumberjacks; the other takes the role of the foxes and bears. Both players hunt each other!&#10;&#10;At first the forest lies peacefully under the face-down tiles. As the players turn the tiles over and move them on the board, the forest awakens and the hunt destroys the serenity of the forest. The lumberjacks cut swaths through the forest to provide hunting fields for the hunters. The bears then use these same aisles to track the hunters and lumberjacks. And both sides hunt the ducks who are just trying to live in peace!&#10;&#10;The two sides are balanced with luck dominating the early game, but skill taking over at the end. Good hunting!&#10;&#10;Originally published by Spear Spiele in 1973 as Jag und Schlag, Kosmos republished the game in 2000 as Tally Ho! / Halali! as part of its Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;"
Tanz der Hornochsen!,Animals,2,8,"From the publisher, AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH:&#10;&#10;This is a boardgame version of the card game Category 5 (more precisely, the version sold as 6 Nimmt!).&#10;&#10;To kick off the celebrations for the 10 year anniversary of the release of his 6 Nimmt! game, Wolfgang Kramer presents Tanz der Hornochsen, a crazy board game. It uses the base concept of the card game, but expands it and enriches it in many ways. So Tanz der Hornochsen is a completely separate gaming experience, one that pleases through both the clever game system as well as the wonderful illustrations by Oliver Freudenreich.&#10;&#10;Two to eight players try to place their cows (cardboard markers with number values) onto the meadow spaces such that they don't land on a bullhead space. The winner, at the end of the game, is the player who is the furthest away from becoming a bullhead. Tanz der Hornochsen lets even players who have no prior experience with the card game quickly get started with the bovine silliness. The bullheads await the dance!&#10;&#10;Play Summary&#10;Each round players will select a tile to play and place it face down in front of them. When everyone is ready, the tiles are revealed.&#10;&#10;Tiles are placed on the board in order, lowest to highest. Which row a tile is placed in is determined according to the following rules:&#10;1. Increasing number value. The number on the tile to be placed must be higher than the number on the tile that is currently the last tile in that row.&#10;2. Smallest difference. The tile must always be placed at the end of the row where there will be the smallest difference between it and the tile currently at that row. All four active rows must be examined to determine which has the smallest difference.&#10;3. Lowest number. If the played tile's number is lower than that of the end tile on all four rows, it must be placed at the end of the row with the highest number.&#10;&#10;When a player places a tile on a cowpie, he scores that many points and moves his pawn that many spaces around the scoring track. If the Happy Cows are active, he gets to move his pawn back (away from the Dung Heap) that many spaces instead of forward (towards the Dung Heap).&#10;&#10;When a player places a tile on the Bullhead at the end of a row, that row is completed and the player must execute the following actions in order:&#10;1. Score penalty points as shown on the Bullhead space by moving his pawn around the score track.&#10;2. Move the just-played tile to the first space on the next unoccupied row.&#10;3. Remove the remaining tiles from the completed row. Choose one or two to keep  (behind his player screen). Place the remaining tiles back in the box or off to the side. They will not be used for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;Enhancements over 6 Nimmt!&#10;Tanz der Hornochsen includes many enhancements over the card game versions of 6 Nimmt!, including: Double Play spaces requiring players to play 2 tiles in a round, Happy Cow spaces that reverse scores while active, the two Bull's Eye spots on the scoring track that give the player closest to the Dung Heap an advantage for a round, and the ability of players to  purchase new tiles each round prior to choosing a tile to play. All these enhancements increase the play dynamic considerably.&#10;&#10;"
Techno Witches,Fantasy,2,4,"Heinrich Glumpler is well-known for his original game ideas. With Zauberstauber (Magic Duster), he's tackled witches - but not the kind of witches that are known to most, that is, wrinkled old crones that fly about on dusty broomsticks. His new generation of witches are totally hip and savvy, and they use high-tech vacuum cleaners to take to the skies - those would be the Magic Dusters. The complicated magical duster technology makes special demands of its pilots. In the good old days, you could simply sit on your broomstick and fly off. But now, the flight pattern of the duster must first be properly programmed into the machine. No surprise then, that witches who aren't yet completely familiar with the new technology often end up on the wrong track while programming their flight routes.&#10;&#10;"

This society of treasure hunters, adventure seekers, and artifact collectors gathers men from around the world to share their tales of glory. Each runs a global network, questing for fame, wealth, and the prestige of their home country. Together they pursue a cult that would use the powerful relics for evil, but each adventurer wants the victory to be his alone.&#10;&#10;Players follow clues and try to collect all the pieces of an ancient artifacts by strategically deploying their forces and gaining majorities in forgotten territories like El Dorado, Atlantis, and Shangri-La. Leading each team are world famous heroes:&#10;&#10;LORD REX HUNTER - Reginald Hunter was heir to a Lordship in Great Britain. His parents were chemists who were doing research in Africa when the family was lost to Ivory poachers. Years later, Rex turned up in the UK with the adventurous spirit and intelligence of his parents and the savage power of his jungle upbringing. He started THE ADVENTURE LEAGUE.&#10;&#10;DRAGON PRINCE - A true member of Eastern aristocracy, the Jade Dragon, as some call him, was never content to sit on his riches. He uses it to help those in need and for his globe-spanning adventures to recover lost artifacts of great wealth and power. Best friend of Lord Rex Hunter, but also his fiercest competitor, the Dragon Prince was the first to join his LEAGUE.&#10;&#10;DOC ROCKET - &quot;Doc Rocket&quot; is Dr. Werner Von Bronz, one of the greatest scientists of 1920's Germany.

He is a former WWI fighter pilot of great courage and nobility, loyal to both his own Germany and the LEAGUE.&#10;&#10;THE WRAITH - All that is know about his previous life is that he was a police officer in a large American city on a crusade against organized crime. He now fights crime on a global scale with relentless energy and sharp focus. Some say he cannot die. His devoted followers supply him with the scientific and financial resources he needs to carry on his campaign for justice, within and outside of the LEAGUE.&#10;&#10;"

The Bucket King,Animals,2,6,"Card game with unusual scoring. Players play sets of animal cards trying to knock over each other's pyramids of buckets. Cards in hand can be used to attack and defend their colour buckets, taking out lower buckets causes cascades.&#10;&#10;The deck is five colours (farm animals) numbered 1-8, with two 1s and two 8s. Players start with 12 cards.  The start player plays 1-3 cards of one colour, giving a total sum. This total attacks the player to their left, who either plays 1-3 cards of the same colour totalling higher to defend, or loses a bucket. If they do defend though, that total then attacks the player to their left and so on, round the table. If it gets back to the start player, then can add 1-3 more cards to their original play, increasing the total. At some point, a player cannot defend, and buckets go tumbling. If you match the total attacking you this reverses the direction of play, meaning the cards already played are being added to additional cards to create high totals.&#10;&#10;Players look at their starting hand before building their pyramid o' buckets, so it pays to put your weak colours at the top.&#10;&#10;If you play a cards or cards, you draw back only one card from the draw deck. If you forget, tough! The game ends when a pre-set number of players lose all their buckets, the number increases with the number playing. The player with the most remaining is the winner.&#10;&#10;A game comes with enough buckets for 6 players, but you can play with multiple sets to allow larger groups to play. This works well as action down the far end of the table means you are safe, while the reversal mechanism means that there can be a build up of a lead to an unmatchable number before it breaks out of that end of the table.&#10;&#10;Seemingly a game of luck, but noticable that the same players keep winning and with experience the winning margins keep getting reduced.&#10;&#10;"

The City,Card Game,2,5,"In The City, players try to quickly and skillfully build their own city over the rounds, bringing in revenue and victory points (VPs). The cards are both buildings and currency, and the first player to collect 50 victory points wins the game. Victory points are cumulative from round to round, so a fast start yields a big advantage.&#10;&#10;Each turn, each player places a card from his hand face down, then all cards are simultaneously revealed. The cards show the buildings that the players want to build that round; building costs are paid for by discarding other cards. Some buildings provide income at the end of the round in the form of new cards, with certain buildings increasing the income provided by others; similarly, some buildings boost the VPs provided by others, with a University, for example, being worth one more VP for each School you have in play.&#10;&#10;Certain buildings have symbols on them &ndash; car, fountain, shopping cart - and the income and VPs provided by some buildings depends on how many symbols you have in play; the Autobahn, for example, is worth one dollar (i.e., card) and one VP for each car symbol you control.&#10;&#10;"
The Downfall of Pompeii,Ancient,2,4,"The year is 79 A.D. Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development. People come to the city from far and wide to try to make their luck in the city. So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?&#10;&#10;The simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required &ndash; along with a little luck &ndash; in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time.&#10;&#10;The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.&#10;&#10;After the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started. The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;The 2013 second edition of The Downfall of Pompeii includes three dual vent tiles and a new &quot;Dual Vent&quot; variant.&#10;&#10;"

You need to buy more boats to increase the columns on which you can fish. You need to buy reef cards (5 in total) on which you breed the parents, first to get 5 offspring wins. There are also pearl cards, which act as joker worms, and sharks, which eliminate cards by eating them.&#10;&#10;There is a deck of offspring, 4 are dealt up, being combinations of the 5 colors. So there are blue green fish, pink yellow fish, purple purple fish. The parents are in the same colors, some male, some female. So, for example, to collect the blue green baby fish, you need a blue male and green female, or a blue female and green male. Any used cards go to the discard, which gets shuffled round and feed back into the reef. The cost of cards depends on their position on the reef, and there is a rule for flowing cards through past your boats.&#10;&#10;The Reef is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;"

To Court the King,Dice,2,5,"In this game, the players are petitioners at the royal court, trying to gain the King's favor. To do so, they must first gain the help of the servants and petty officials at the court, who can then help them gain access to the nobility, who, in turn, can help to reach the king.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. On their turn, a player will gather his dice, roll them, set aside at least one, and roll the remaining dice again, until all dice have been set aside. After that, he gets to select a character who will help him. Each character requires a certain combination of dice (such as two pairs or dice that show at least 30 points). The character will give the player some benefits on later rolls, such as an additional die or the ability to modify the results of a roll.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player gains the support of the Queen (and temporary favor of the King, winning ties in the final roll-off).

Tongiaki,Exploration,2,6,"The game of seafaring adventure in ancient Polynesia!&#10;&#10;Tongiaki is a tile-laying game that reflects the risks and successes of these early explorers.  There is often a chance that an expedition will end in utter failure... or, it might land in Tahiti, Fiji, or Oahu.  Clever players might even found Royal Islands to call their own!  Only fate will decide if, and where, sailors make landfall, although careful planning will give players the best odds for ever seeing land again.  The goal of the game is to spread your &quot;tribe&quot; to many different islands in order to gain the most victory points.  Islands have victory point values from 2-5, and having multiple pawns on an island gives no bonus.&#10;&#10;This game uses a unique tile design never seen in any other game (hexes with wavy edges), and is easy to explain and easy to enjoy.  Players all begin on the island of Tonga, and immediate overcrowding forces players to search out other islands to populate.  For each expedition that leaves, a new tile is placed, revealing either an island, or a &quot;water path&quot; that may or may not have a number from 2-4, indicating that many different players (not number of boats) must make up that expedition for it to survive the voyage (draw and place an additional tile).  In this way, the game encourages both cooperative and competitive play at the same time.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;300AD: The Polynesians embark on daring sailing trips and explore thousands of Pacific islands.  Driven by overpopulation and a desire for adventure, they set forth into the unknown on simple catamarans called Tongiakis.  Without any help from navigational instruments, they charted their course with the help of the sun, stars, wind and water temperature.  Birds, reefs, cloud formations, fishes and distinctive waves were the signals telling them that land lay nearby.  Each trip became a life-threatening journey, as landfall was often impossible to achieve or the way home became cut off by strong currents.  Suspense was their constant companion.  Will the next hour, the next day bring them to their goal...  Or will the ocean's currents force them to drift endlessly at sea?&#10;&#10;Description from Uberplay's web site:&#10;&#10;While originally designed to be somewhat cooperative, it can easily be played 'aggressively' in such a way as to rob other players of points and diminishing their presence on the board. The movement of pieces reaches a point where a 'triggered cascade' can alter the game drastically. Trying to foresee and select expansion moves leads to a weighty-er game than suggested at first glance.&#10;&#10;"
Too Many Cooks,Card Game,2,5,"This Reiner Knizia concoction is a sort of a trick-taking game, but instead of everybody playing one card and seeing which one wins the trick, everybody takes turns adding cards until the total adds up to 10 or more and the player who added that card takes the whole pile.&#10;&#10;This can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the player's goal for that particular round!  There are five rounds in the game and exactly five different goals to be fulfilled:  to take as many mushroom cards as you can, or as many pea soup cards, or as many onion cards, or as many chili pepper cards, or to take no cards at all.  (The pepper cards, incidentally, count minus 1 unless your goal for the round is to collect them.)  Goals are revealed simultaneously, so you may or may not be in competition with another player for the same cards during the round.  And you can't choose a goal you've already chosen, so things can get pretty tough especially on the last hand, where no matter what cards you're dealt, you *have* to go for whichever of the five goals you haven't done already.&#10;&#10;Since the game is always exactly five rounds, it lasts a good dependable half an hour every time.&#10;&#10;"
Top Speed,Card Game,2,2,"Top Speed has two players racing to place their cards on eight rows. Cards have two attributes - color and icon. On each row, there can be only one card with each color and each icon. Once one of the players empties their hand, the game ends. Rows are scored (they are worth one to five points) so that the player who played the last card wins the row. If there's a mistake, the first player to make a mistake loses the row. The game is over in just few minutes.&#10;&#10;"
Torres,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"Torres is an abstract game of resource management and tactical pawn movement.  Players are attempting to build up castles and position their knights to score the most points each turn.  Players have a limited supply of knights and action cards that allow special actions to be taken.  Efficient use of pieces and cards, along with a thoughtful awareness of future possibilities, is the heart of this game.&#10;&#10;Torres is considered by many to be an informal member of what is referred to as the Mask Trilogy.&#10;&#10;"
Tower of Babel,Ancient,3,5,"Together, the players use cards to try to build the eight wonders of the ancient world. The number they build varies, but can't be more than seven. (Hence the subtitle of the game, &quot;...or why the eighth wonder was never built.&quot;) While building together, each tries to provide the majority of the components for each wonder and collect scoring disks (in four suits). When it's someone else turn, you offer cards to the active player, and by good offers, can earn points (or sometimes even the disk).  So a feature of &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; is that players always perform actions and can earn points during another's turn. Card trade offers, collecting disk sets, and building wonders are the three ways to earn victory points. The game ends when a player takes the last disk of any one of the four suits, so players have some influence on the game's end moment.  And, the victory points determine the winner at game end. Typical game length is less than an hour.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reiner Knizia Variant--some recommend against using the action cards because the publisher rather than Reiner Knizia added them and because they damage the game balance. To play with this variant, simply leave the action cards in the box. There is no bonus to the person who completes the final stage of a wonder.&#10;&#10;&#10;"
Trains,Card Game,2,4,"In the 19th century, shortly after the industrial revolution, railways quickly spread over the world.

Trampelfanten,Animals,2,5,"Trampelfanten, or Stampeding Elephants, is a dice rolling game where players are racing elephants.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 6 elephants, 6 corresponding cards, 2 dice with coloured sides, a game board and instructions.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players each take a coloured elephants and its card representation. Any elephants left over are the maharaja's elephants. The cards remind the players which elephants are the maharaja's or the players.&#10;&#10;To move the pieces, players roll the coloured dice and heed the following rules: different colours - move those two elephants, same colours - move the elephant back one square. The next player has the choice to keep one of the dice or re-roll both.&#10;&#10;Elephants work their way to the end of the board until one reaches the turn square. When this happens, all elephants turn around to race back to the start.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there is only one elephant left on the track. If that elephant belongs to a player, he/she is the winner. If it is the maharaja's, the first player who made it back to the start is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is a re-theming of Das St&#195;&#182;rrische Muli&#10;&#10;"
TransAmerica,Trains,2,6,TransAmerica is a very simple railway game. Each player has a set of 5 cities strung across the US that need to be connected by rail. Players place either 1 or 2 rails each turn. The game ends when the first player completes a connected route between his 5 cities. The player who can make the best use of the other players' networks is generally victorious.&#10;&#10;
Trias,Animals,2,5,"Dinosaurs reside on the modular hexagons of the super-continent Pangaea. Each hex can only support a certain number of animals. Not only that, the continent is splitting up with parts of the land disappearing and new lands emerging elsewhere.  Players try to disperse as widely as is wise while still dominating each continent where they exist. The game ends as the meteorite strikes, ending the age of the great dinosaurs.&#10;&#10;Players begin by placing herds of their dinosaurs on the single continent of Pangea, made from tiles of various terrain types. They then take turns, which comprise of drifting tiles, conducting optional actions, and finally resolving any of their own tribes that have been left in water or on overpopulated tiles. The first phase, the drift, involves a player moving a landscape tile of the same type as depicted on the card they play. The tile must be moved further away from the South Pole (the centre of Pangea) than it already is, must remain a part of the same continent and must be attached to a continent with that player's herds. Players have 4 action points to spend on other optional actions, including another drift, migrating herds, rescuing swimming herds and reproducing to create more herds.&#10;&#10;Points are scored during the game whenever a new separate continent is formed as a result of a landscape tile drift, as well as at the end of the game for each continent. During the game, the player with the most herds on the new continent scores 2 points, while the player with the second-most scores 1. End-game scoring is much more significant, as the player with the most herds gains 1 point per landscape tile on the continent, and the player with the second most scores half that amount.&#10;&#10;The final round begins when the meteor strike card is drawn, and the game then ends. After final scoring is completed, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Premiere: Essen 2002&#10;&#10;"
Triology,Card Game,2,4,"Triology is a melding of SET and rummy.  Each turn players look for SETs in their hand of nine cards, drawing if they cannot lay down a SET.  Players may also poach off of other players SETS if they contribute at least two new cards.  Hands Off! cards prevent this, and players score points for the number of SETs scored when a player runs out of cards.&#10;&#10;"
Turbo Taxi,Puzzle,2,4,"Flickwerk is a neat little competitive puzzle game, similar in feel to Ricochet Robot. With multiple sets, even more players can participate in the same game.&#10;&#10;Each player has an identical set of 12 tiles displaying part of a network of computer cables. A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four &ldquo;perimeter&rdquo; markers. First one to complete a valid network wins the centre tile (1 VP). He then rearranges the perimeter markers if he wishes and turns over the next card to be played for.&#10;&#10;The updated edition, Turbo Taxi, features city streets rather than computer cables. The markers on the edge of the grid are a yellow taxi, yellow house, black taxi and black house. Players must ensure that their tiles create valid routes leading the yellow taxi to the yellow house, and black taxi to the black house.&#10;&#10;This game can also be played solo as you try to complete a grid in the least amount of time.&#10;&#10;"
Tutankhamen,Abstract Strategy,2,6,"There are 69 artifact tiles in the game of Tutanchamun. These are shuffled and then laid out randomly in a long, serpentine trail. Players take turns choosing any tile from the trail, but can never turn back to choose a tile they have already passed. There are 15 different sets of tiles (three sets each of 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1), and when the last tile of any set has been claimed, the player holding the most in that set scores that number of points, while the player holding second most scores half that number. Complicating matters, there are also three tie-breaker tiles and three tiles that let you &quot;buy&quot; a tile from another player. It's an exercise in numbers that plays quickly, probably 30 minutes tops, and is suitable for youngsters yet susceptible to analysis. The game has a unique layout and a brightly-colored Egyptian pharaoh look. The new edition by Out of the Box Publishing games has different graphics, but is otherwise substantially similar to the original.&#10;&#10;"
Twixt,Abstract Strategy,2,4,"Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.&#10;&#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;"
Typo,Card Game,2,6,"Players are dealt 12 cards from an alphabetic deck and play them to the table in rows and columns to make words, or the start of words. Players choose their cards simultaneously. When the cards are shown, the lowest in the alphabet goes first and so on. Players add their card to the rows or columns on the table, calling the word or part-word they are forming, so adding E to the start of LAST gives ELAST, for which you can call &quot;elastic&quot;.&#10;&#10;All cards must be placed, so if you cannot form a valid word to call, you pick up the longest line of cards, which will score against you.

TZAAR,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"TZAAR is a game about making choices. Both players have 30 pieces, divided in three types: 6 Tzaars, 9 Tzarras and 15 Totts. The 3 types of pieces form a trinity: They cannot exist without each other. The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture anymore. The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: &ldquo;Shall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?&rdquo; Meaning: Will you capture an opponent&rsquo;s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do? Up to you to decide!&#10;&#10;TZAAR is the most recent game in project GIPF, replacing TAMSK which was felt to not quite fit in with the others due to its use of sand timers.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net (real time, against human or robot opponents)&#10;     Gamerz (turn-based, play by email or play by web)&#10;     Bo&#195;&#174;te_&#195;&#160;_jeux (turn-based, play by web, robot opponents also available)&#10;&#10;&#10; Local Computer Play &#10;&#10;     HTZAAR (made from Haskell, OpenGL, and SDL; can be compiled for Windows or Linux) (NOTE: this is no longer maintained)&#10;     http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~pbv/stuff/hstzaar HsTZAAR: improved version of HTZAAR with better AI and better graphical interface.

Ubongo,Puzzle,2,4,"In Ubongo, players compete to solve individual puzzles as quickly as they can to get first crack at the gems on hand for the taking.&#10;&#10;The game board consists of six rows, with twelve gems (of various colors) placed in these rows. At the start of play, each player places his pawn in front of one of those rows. Each player also takes twelve polyominoes &mdash; that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of shares; one side of this card depicts six rows of pieces, and when everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board.&#10;&#10;Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on.&#10;&#10;"
Union Pacific,Economic,2,6,"Union Pacific is a train-themed stock market game.  On each turn, players must choose between expanding a company to increase its value and adding a share of stock to their hand, or playing stock onto the table from their hand to increase their ownership of one or two companies.  There are four semi-random scoring events, in which the first and second place share holder in each company are paid dividends.  Only stock that has been previously played onto the table is considered during the scoring rounds.   Union Pacific is a special company whose shares are claimed according to special rules.

Paletti too had little money, but instead he had a marvelous plan. Why buy new columns when he could re-use the old ones that his Grandfather had built?  All he needed to do was remove some of those holding up the first floor, of which there were far too many in any case, and rebuild them further up, so that they could support new floors,  reaching up towards the skies!&#10;&#10;&quot;Excellent, Paletti&quot; shouted his friends, and they quickly started to work.  Soon they had a marvelous building in front of them, the &quot;Villa Paletti&quot;. Nowadays, no one knows what it was caused the collapse of the Vila Paletti, perhaps a puff of wind, or a slight earth tremor, but all the experts are united on one point, that Paletti,  far ahead of his time, was the first to discover something whose full importance is only now starting to become clear to us, the Euro pallet!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Palazzo Paletti&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"

With &quot;slow play&quot;, a sand timer is turned over and each writes words/phrases on their own pad. Making words/phrases requires using a pair of picture dice for each word/phrase. For example a picture of a snowflake and a picture of an eye can make &quot;cold stare&quot;. Once time is up, each player compares their list, only scoring a point for the word/phrase no-one else has written. In &quot;fast play&quot;, all players shout out the word/phrase, the quicker player removing the pair of dice from the box.

A player can choose to change the number on a die up or down by one instead of moving.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around attempting to land on other ships (friendly or otherwise) which allows sliding down at least one loop of spiral until it reaches an unoccupied spot, thus cutting out a lot of transit time.

(Tasks include things like &quot;Take no tricks&quot;, &quot;Take 1 Trick&quot;, or &quot;Take No Red Cards&quot;.)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.

Where's Bob's Hat?,Card Game,3,5,"A form of estimation whist, with three colored suits (cards from 1 to 20), and the possibility of trumps or no-trumps.   You have to bid for which suit (or suits) you think you will capture most cards of, or you can bid to capture fewer cards than anyone else.   Get it right, you score; get it wrong, you take a penalty.

This edition has better graphics and uses the same mechanism of 4 symbols on the horse cards also appearing on the die. Players roll the die and choose which horse you want to move from those not taken their turn yet. The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and so either co-operate or compete to get their horses over the line. There are money tokens now for the winners, but not enough supplied in the game to pay out properly.&#10;&#10;There are various differences between this edition and THR. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval, the horses start in a line of seven places, not all together. In the race, they cannot share spaces so a horse can only move to the next available empty space. This can make it easy to block the ones at the back and it's nearly possible to lap the final horse, or end the race before it's even crossed the start line. I've never seen a horse race where they start nose to tail!&#10;&#10;There is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 2,1 and 1 betting chips of the basic game.

With a proprietary 60 card deck comprising a standard deck plus 4 Wizards (high) and 4 Jesters (low). In the first hand 1 card is dealt to each player. In the second 2 and so on. The game is over after the hand in which all cards are dealt.&#10;&#10;Trumps are determined by randomly showing a card from the rest of undealt pack, if the card is a Jester, NoTrump is played in the current round. If it is a wizard, the last player to bid gets to choose the trump, or choose to play NoTrump.&#10;&#10;After examining your cards you state the number of tricks you will win. Each round each player puts down one card. The first Wizard played wins the trick, followed by the highest trump card, followed by the highest card in the suit of the first card played.&#10;&#10;You get 20 points for correctly predicting how many tricks you will win, plus 10 points for each trick won. You lose 10 points for each trick over or under the amount you predicted.&#10;&#10;The game has plenty of luck inherent into it, especially at first (the first few rounds). Later rounds have very little luck, and because scoring increases over time (more cards are being dealt, so bids are higher), the overall game is a very skillful game.&#10;&#10;Good memory, counting, and knowledge of statistics are helpful in this game. &#10;[However, &quot;Wizard is pure fun, challenging, baffling and simply habit forming. Wizard is quickly becoming the most popular card game of the decade,&quot; according to the undated box. So presumably everyone can enjoy it, skilled or not.]&#10;&#10;This game can easily be played with a standard deck with some jesters and extra cards with the same backing, but has been sold in various formats over the years as a special deck with wizards and jesters added.  It differs from the games it originates from in that the typical format was to start at one card dealt and go up to the maximum amount, and then go back down again (in some versions this ordering is reversed and you start dealing the maximum amount down to one card, then back up).  Wizard shortens the game by starting at one card dealt and going up the maximum (which sometimes makes the last round have no trump since if the deck is divisible perfectly by the amount of players, there is no card to flip to determine trump in the last round).&#10;&#10;"

Players simultaneously start picking up one of the thirteen little wooden containers and shaking them. Inside the containers are one to thirteen lead pellets. Players are trying to select the container with the highest number of pellets, so long as it doesn't exceed the result of the dice. Once all players have selected their container (the number of pellets are denoted on a sticker on the bottom), players move one-by-one from highest to lowest, assuming their selection allows them to move at all by being lower.&#10;&#10;"
ZÈRTZ,Abstract Strategy,2,2,"In this third addition to the GIPF Project players compete to acquire sets of multi-colored balls.  This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board.  A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board.  In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.&#10;&#10;This game is part of project GIPF.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.gipf.com/zertz/index.html&#10;&#10;"
